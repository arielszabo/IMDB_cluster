It co-stars Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Rose McGowan, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Thoms and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, with stuntwoman Zo\u00eb Bell as herself. The film pays homage to the slasher, exploitation and muscle car films of the 1970s.\nDeath Proof was released theatrically in the United States as part of a double feature with Robert Rodriguez\u2019s Planet Terror under the collective title Grindhouse, to recreate the experience of viewing exploitation film double features in a \"grindhouse\" theater.
