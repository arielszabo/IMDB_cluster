{"text": "\n\nClueless is a 1995 American coming-of-age romantic comedy film written and directed by Amy Heckerling. It stars Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash, Paul Rudd and Brittany Murphy, and was produced by Scott Rudin and Robert Lawrence. It is loosely based on Jane Austen's 1815 novel Emma, updating the setting to modern-day Beverly Hills. The film's director, Heckerling, studied real Beverly Hills high school students to get the lingo and feel for how real teens in the 1980s talked. The famous quote \"as if!\" came from Heckerling's study of these teens.\nThe film grossed $56.1 million in the United States, received generally positive reviews from critics, and has developed a cult following. The film was followed by a spin-off television sitcom and series of books.\n", "wiki_page_id": 105872, "imdb_id": "tt0112697"}
