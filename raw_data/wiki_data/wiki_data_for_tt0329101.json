{"text": "Freddy vs. Jason is a 2003 American slasher film directed by Ronny Yu and written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift. The film is a crossover between A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th series, and pits Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees against each other in the eighth and eleventh installments in their respective series. The film is also the last in both A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th series before they were both rebooted.\nIn the film, Freddy (Robert Englund) has grown incapable of haunting people's dreams as the citizens of Springwood, Ohio, have mostly forgotten about him following his death and subsequent imprisonment in Hell for his sins. To regain his power and freedom, Freddy resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and manipulates him into traveling to Springwood to cause panic and fear, leading to rumors that Freddy has returned. However, while Jason succeeds in causing enough fear for Freddy to haunt the town again, Jason angers Freddy by depriving him of potential victims. This ultimately sends the two undead monsters into a violent conflict.\nFreddy vs. Jason was released in the United States on August 15, 2003. It grossed $114 million, making it the highest-grossing film in the Friday the 13th series and the second-highest-grossing film in A Nightmare on Elm Street series. The film is Englund's final appearance to date as Freddy Krueger.\n", "wiki_page_id": 714334, "imdb_id": "tt0329101"}
