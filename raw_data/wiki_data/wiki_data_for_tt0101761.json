{"text": "The Doors is a 1991 American biographical film about the 1960\u201370s rock band of the same name which emphasizes the life of its lead singer, Jim Morrison. It was directed by Oliver Stone, and stars Val Kilmer as Morrison and Meg Ryan as Pamela Courson (Morrison's companion). The film features Kyle MacLachlan as Ray Manzarek, Frank Whaley as Robby Krieger, Kevin Dillon as John Densmore, and Kathleen Quinlan as Patricia Kennealy.\nThe film portrays Morrison as the larger-than-life icon of 1960s rock and roll, counterculture, and the drug-using free love hippie lifestyle. But the depiction goes beyond the iconic: his alcoholism, interest in hallucinogenic drugs as entheogens, and, particularly, his growing obsession with death are threads which weave in and out of the film.  The film was not well received by his band mates, close friends, and family, due to its depiction of Morrison.\n", "wiki_page_id": 604150, "imdb_id": "tt0101761"}
