{"text": "\n\nBreathless (French: \u00c0 bout de souffle; \"out of breath\") is a 1960 French New Wave crime drama film written and directed by Jean-Luc Godard about a wandering criminal (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his American girlfriend (Jean Seberg). It was Godard's first feature-length work and represented Belmondo's breakthrough as an actor.\nBreathless was one of the earliest, most influential examples of French New Wave (nouvelle vague) cinema. Together with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's The 400 Blows and Alain Resnais's Hiroshima, Mon Amour, both released a year earlier, it brought international acclaim to this new style of French filmmaking. At the time, the film attracted much attention for its bold visual style, which included unconventional use of jump cuts.\nA fully restored version of the film was released in the U.S. for its 50th anniversary in May 2010. When originally released in France, the film attracted over 2 million viewers.\n", "wiki_page_id": 339526, "imdb_id": "tt0053472"}
