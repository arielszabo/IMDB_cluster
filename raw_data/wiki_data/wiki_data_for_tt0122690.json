{"text": "\n\nRonin is a 1998 American action thriller film written by John David Zeik and David Mamet (using the pseudonym Richard Weisz) and directed by John Frankenheimer. It stars Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Sean Bean, and Jonathan Pryce. In the story, a team of former special operatives is hired to steal a mysterious, heavily guarded briefcase while navigating a maze of shifting loyalties. The film is noted for its realistic car chases in Nice and Paris and its convoluted plot, using the case as a MacGuffin. \nFrankenheimer signed in 1997 to direct Zeik's screenplay, which Mamet rewrote significantly to expand De Niro's role and develop plot details. Principal photography was done in France from November 3, 1997 to March 3, 1998 and was supervised by the French cinematographer Robert Fraisse. Vehicle stunts were coordinated and performed by professional race-car drivers. Elia Cmiral scored the film, his first for a major studio.\nRonin premiered at the 1998 Venice Film Festival before its general release on September 25. Performing moderately well at the box office, the film had a warm critical reception. Considered a return to form for Frankenheimer, it was his last well-received feature film. Film critic and historian Stephen Prince called Ronin Frankenheimer's \"end-of-career masterpiece\". The car chases, which were favorably compared to Bullitt and The French Connection, made several media outlets' lists as some of the best portrayed in film.\n", "wiki_page_id": 163438, "imdb_id": "tt0122690"}
