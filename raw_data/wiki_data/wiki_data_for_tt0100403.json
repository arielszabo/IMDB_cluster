{"text": "Predator 2 is a 1990 American science fiction action film written by brothers Jim and John Thomas, directed by Stephen Hopkins, and starring Danny Glover, Ruben Blades, Gary Busey, Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Peter Hall. The film, second installment of the Predator\u00a0franchise, is a sequel to Predator (1987), with Kevin Peter Hall reprising the title role of the Predator.\nThe film received negative reviews, despite earning a moderate return at the box office grossing $57 million worldwide, and was considered a disappointment compared to the previous film's $98 million gross on a smaller production budget. It has, however, become a cult film among fans. A sequel followed 20 years later in 2010.\n", "wiki_page_id": 620034, "imdb_id": "tt0100403"}
