{"text": "\n\nMimic is a 1997 American science fiction horror film co-written and directed by Guillermo del Toro based on Donald A. Wollheim's short story of the same name, and starring Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam, Josh Brolin, Charles S. Dutton, Giancarlo Giannini and F. Murray Abraham. The film features Norman Reedus in his film debut.\nDel Toro was unhappy with the film as released, especially because he did not succeed in obtaining a final cut of the film; however, his director's cut version was finally released in 2011. Mimic, whose U.S. theatrical gross was $25.5 million, was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, Mimic 2 (2001) and Mimic 3: Sentinel (2003), neither of which involved del Toro.\nIt includes several examples of del Toro's most characteristic hallmarks. \"I have a sort of a fetish for insects, clockwork, monsters, dark places, and unborn things,\" said del Toro, and this is evident in Mimic, where at times all are combined in long, brooding shots of dark, cluttered, muddy chaotic spaces. According to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, del Toro's friend and colleague, \"with Guillermo the shots are almost mathematical \u2014 everything is planned.\"", "wiki_page_id": 1168522, "imdb_id": "tt0119675"}
