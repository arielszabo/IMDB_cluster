{"text": "\n\nThis Is Spinal Tap (stylized as This Is Sp\u0131n\u0308al Tap) is a 1984 American mockumentary directed and co-written by Rob Reiner. It stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer as members of the fictional British heavy metal band Spinal Tap, and Reiner as Marty Di Bergi, a documentary filmmaker following the band on their US tour.\nThe film satirizes the behavior and musical pretensions of rock bands and the hagiographic tendencies of rock documentaries such as Gimme Shelter (1970), The Song Remains the Same (1976) and The Last Waltz (1978). Most of the dialogue was improvised, and dozens of hours were filmed.\nThis is Spinal Tap received positive reviews. In 2002, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation by the United States National Film Registry.\n", "wiki_page_id": 99545, "imdb_id": "tt0088258"}
