{"text": "Natural Born Killers: A Soundtrack for an Oliver Stone Film is the soundtrack to the film Natural Born Killers, produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Reznor reportedly produced the soundtrack using a portable Pro Tools in his hotel room while on his band\u2019s Self Destruct Tour.  On his approach to compiling the soundtrack, Reznor told MTV:\n\nI suggested to Oliver [Stone] to try to turn the soundtrack into a collage-of-sound, kind of the way the movie used music: make edits, add dialog, and make it something interesting, rather than a bunch of previously released music.\nSome songs were written especially for the film or soundtrack, such as \"Burn\" by Nine Inch Nails.\n", "wiki_page_id": 4323386, "imdb_id": "tt0110632"}
