{"text": "\n\nRab Ne Bana Di Jodi (English: A Match Made By God), also known as RNBDJ, is a 2008 Indian romantic comedy film written and directed by Aditya Chopra and produced by Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra under the banner Yash Raj Films. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan and newcomer Anushka Sharma in the lead roles. Khan plays a mild-mannered office worker named Surinder Sahni, whose love for the beautiful and vivacious Taani (Anushka Sharma) causes him to transform himself into the loud and fun-loving \"Raj\" to win her love. It was released worldwide on 12 December 2008 and marked Aditya Chopra's return to directing after an eight-year break, following his previous film, Mohabbatein.\nThe film was not heavily promoted pre-release, contrary to previous Khan or Yash Raj films, mainly because of the filmmakers' decision to keep it low-profile because of the terror attacks in Mumbai. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and broke many box office records. It was declared a blockbuster despite the fact that it was released only two weeks after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, amidst uncertainty and apprehensions from the trade regarding market conditions at the time. At the end of its theatrical run, it grossed over \u20b91.58 billion (US$22\u00a0million) worldwide and was also the highest-grossing film of the year in the overseas market, thus becoming Yash Raj Films and Shahrukh Khan's highest-grossing film at the time of its release. The film's soundtrack was composed by Salim-Sulaiman, and it became the first Bollywood soundtrack to reach the top ten albums sales for the iTunes Store.The film's script was recognised by a number of critics and was invited to be included in the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, just a day after its release. The script is accessible for research purposes only; students, filmmakers, writers and actors are among the regular patrons.", "wiki_page_id": 17458139, "imdb_id": "tt1182937"}
