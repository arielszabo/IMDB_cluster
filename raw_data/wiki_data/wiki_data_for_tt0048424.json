{"text": "The Night of the Hunter is a 1955 American thriller directed by Charles Laughton, and starring Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, and Lillian Gish. The screenplay by James Agee was based on the 1953 novel of the same name by Davis Grubb. The plot focuses on a corrupt minister-turned-serial killer who attempts to charm an unsuspecting widow and steal $10,000 hidden by her executed husband.\nThe novel and film draw on the true story of Harry Powers who was hanged in 1932 for the murder of two widows and three children in Clarksburg, West Virginia. The film's lyrical and expressionistic style with its leaning on the silent era sets it apart from other Hollywood films of the 1940s and 1950s, and it has influenced later directors such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Robert Altman.In 1992, The Night of the Hunter was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The influential film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma selected The Night of the Hunter in 2008 as the second-best film of all time, behind Citizen Kane.", "wiki_page_id": 75264, "imdb_id": "tt0048424"}
