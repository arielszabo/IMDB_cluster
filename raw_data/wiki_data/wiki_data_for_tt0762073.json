{"text": "\n\nThirst (Korean: \ubc15\uc950; Bakjwi; literally: Bat) is a 2009 South Korean horror film written, produced and directed by Park Chan-wook. It is loosely based on the novel Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin by \u00c9mile Zola. The film tells the story of a Catholic priest\u2014who is in love with his friend\u2019s wife\u2014turning into a vampire through a failed medical experiment. Park has stated, \"This film was originally called 'The Bat' to convey a sense of horror. After all, it is about vampires. But it is also more than that. It is about passion and a love triangle. I feel that it is unique because it is not just a thriller, and not merely a horror film, but an illicit love story as well.\" The film won the Jury Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. It is the first mainstream Korean film to feature full-frontal male nudity.", "wiki_page_id": 17405162, "imdb_id": "tt0762073"}
