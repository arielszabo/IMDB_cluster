{"text": "Fever Pitch (released as The Perfect Catch outside the United States and Canada) is a 2005 romantic comedy film. It is directed by the Farrelly brothers, and stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon. It is a remake of the 1997 British film of the same name, which was loosely based on Nick Hornby's best-selling memoir, Fever Pitch: A Fan's Life (1992). Hornby wrote the screenplay for the original film and was an executive producer for the American remake.While both the book and the original 1997 film are about association football, the 2005 adaptation, aimed at the U.S. market, is about baseball. Both Fever Pitch films feature real-life dramatic or unexpected sporting victories, the original focusing on Arsenal's last minute League title win in 1989, and the remake on the Boston Red Sox's 2004 World Series Championship.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1448684, "imdb_id": "tt0332047"}
