{"text": "\n\nBorn on the Fourth of July is a 1989 American biographical war drama film based on the eponymous 1976 autobiography by Ron Kovic. Directed by Oliver Stone, and written by Stone and Kovic, it stars Tom Cruise, Kyra Sedgwick, Raymond J. Barry, Jerry Levine, Frank Whaley and Willem Dafoe. The film depicts the life of Kovic (Cruise) over a twenty-year period, detailing his childhood, his military service and paralysis during the Vietnam War, and his transition to anti-war activism. It is the second installment in Stone's trilogy of films about the Vietnam War, following Platoon (1986) and preceding Heaven & Earth (1993).\nProducer Martin Bregman acquired the film rights to the book in 1976 and hired Stone, also a Vietnam veteran, to co-write the screenplay with Kovic. When Stone optioned the book in 1978, the film adaptation became mired in development hell, and resulted in him and Kovic putting the film on hold. After the release of Platoon, the project was revived at Universal Pictures, with Stone attached to direct. Principal photography commenced in October 1988 and concluded in December after 65 days of filming. It was shot on locations in the Philippines, Texas and Inglewood, California. The film went over its initial $14 million production budget, and ended up costing $17.8 million after reshoots.\nUpon release, Born on the Fourth of July grossed over $161 million worldwide, and became the tenth highest-grossing film of 1989. It received several accolades and praise for its story, Cruise's performance and Stone's direction. At the 62nd Academy Awards, the film received eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor, and won for Best Director and Best Film Editing. It also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama, Best Director and Best Screenplay.\n", "wiki_page_id": 4457806, "imdb_id": "tt0096969"}
