{"text": "\n\nBorat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan  (or simply Borat) is a 2006 British-American mockumentary comedy film written and produced by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen who also plays the title character, Borat Sagdiyev, a fictitious Kazakh journalist travelling through the United States recording real-life interactions with Americans. The film was directed by Larry Charles and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Much of the film features unscripted vignettes of Borat interviewing and interacting with Americans, who believe he is a foreigner with little or no understanding of American customs. It is the second of three films built around Baron Cohen's characters from Da Ali G Show (2000\u201304): the first, Ali G Indahouse, was released in 2002, and featured a cameo by Borat, and the third, Br\u00fcno, was released in 2009. The film is produced by Baron Cohen's production company, Four By Two Productions (\"Four By Two\" is Cockney rhyming slang for \"Jew\").The film was well received, both critically and commercially; it earned $262 million worldwide. Baron Cohen won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, as Borat, while the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy in the same category. Borat was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 79th Academy Awards.\nControversy surrounded the film from two years prior to its release, and after the film's release, some cast members spoke against, and even sued, its creators. It was banned in all Arab countries except Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates (which released the film heavily censored), and the Russian government discouraged Russian cinemas from showing it. It was released on DVD 5 March 2007 (a day later in Region 1 countries).\n", "wiki_page_id": 5574594, "imdb_id": "tt0443453"}
