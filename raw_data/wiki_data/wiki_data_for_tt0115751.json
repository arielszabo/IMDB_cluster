{"text": "\n\nBreaking the Waves is a 1996 film directed by Lars von Trier and starring Emily Watson. Set in the Scottish Highlands in the early 1970s, it is about an unusual young woman, Bess McNeill, and of the love she has for Jan, her husband, who asks her to have sex with other men when he becomes immobilized from a work accident. The film is an international co-production led by Lars von Trier's Danish company Zentropa. It is the first film in Trier's Golden Heart Trilogy which also includes The Idiots (1998) and Dancer in the Dark (2000).\nAs von Trier's first film made after his founding of the Dogme 95 movement, it is heavily influenced by the movement's style and ethos, although the movie breaks several of the rules laid out by the movement's manifesto. Breaking the Waves has been described as \"perhaps von Trier's most widely acclaimed film\", and has won numerous awards including the Grand Prix  at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.", "wiki_page_id": 781946, "imdb_id": "tt0115751"}
