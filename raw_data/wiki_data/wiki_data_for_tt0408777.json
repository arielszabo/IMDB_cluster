{"text": "\n\nThe Edukators (German: Die fetten Jahre sind vorbei) is a 2004 German-Austrian crime drama film directed by Hans Weingartner. It stars Daniel Br\u00fchl, Stipe Erceg and Julia Jentsch as three young, anti-capitalist Berlin activists involved in a love triangle. The friends, calling themselves \"the Edukators\", invade upper-class houses, rearrange the furniture, and leave notes identifying themselves.\nWeingartner, a former activist, wrote the film based on his experiences and chose to use nonviolent characters. The film, shot in Berlin and Austria with digital hand-held cameras, was made on a low budget which Weingartner said kept the focus on the acting. First shown at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2004 and released in its home countries later that year, The Edukators was praised by critics and audiences. It grossed more than $8\u00a0million worldwide and received a number of awards and nominations. It did, however, receive criticism mainly for its political statements and also for its long running time.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1554502, "imdb_id": "tt0408777"}
