{"text": "Fletch is a 1985 American action-comedy directed by Michael Ritchie and written by Andrew Bergman and is loosely based on Gregory Mcdonald's popular Fletch novels. The film stars Chevy Chase, Tim Matheson, Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, Geena Davis and Joe Don Baker.\nThe film revolves around Los Angeles Times reporter Irwin M. \"Fletch\" Fletcher (Chevy Chase), who is offered a large sum of money to kill a millionaire with a terminal cancer prognosis. Fletch becomes suspicious when he discovers the man is not ill; when he continues to investigate, his life is threatened.\nIn the 1970s, Burt Reynolds and Mick Jagger were considered to portray Fletch but these suggestions were rejected by Mcdonald. The author agreed to the casting of Chevy Chase despite never seeing the comedian in anything. Chase reportedly enjoyed the role because it allowed him to play several different characters and work with props. In a 2004 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Chase confirmed this was his favorite role.Fletch fared well from critics and performed well at the box office. It has since developed a cult following. It was followed by a 1989 sequel, Fletch Lives. A prequel, Fletch Won, has been in development for over two decades.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2484540, "imdb_id": "tt0089155"}
