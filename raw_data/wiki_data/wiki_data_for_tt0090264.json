Although the title is adapted from Ian Fleming's short story \"From a View to a Kill\", the film has an entirely original screenplay. In A View to a Kill, Bond is pitted against Max Zorin, who plans to destroy California's Silicon Valley.\nThe film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who also wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum. It was the third James Bond film to be directed by John Glen, and the last to feature Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny.\nDespite receiving mixed to negative reviews from critics, it was a commercial success, with the Duran Duran theme song \"A View to a Kill\" performing well in the charts, becoming the only theme song to reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Song. Christopher Walken was also praised for portraying a \"classic Bond villain\".", "wiki_page_id": 583932, "imdb_id": "tt0090264"}
