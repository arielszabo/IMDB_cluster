{"text": "\n\nA Tale of Two Sisters (Hangul:\u00a0\uc7a5\ud654, \ud64d\ub828; RR:\u00a0Janghwa, Hongryeon; lit. \"Rose Flower, Red Lotus\") is a 2003 South Korean psychological horror drama film written and directed by Kim Jee-woon. The film is inspired by a Joseon Dynasty era folktale entitled Janghwa Hongryeon jeon, which has been adapted to film several times. The plot focuses on a recently released patient from a mental institution who returns home with her sister, only to face disturbing events between her stepmother and the ghosts haunting their house- all of which are connected to a dark past in the family's history.\nThe film opened to very positive reviews from critics and won Best Picture at the 2004 Fantasporto Film Festival. It is both the highest-grossing Korean horror film and the first to be screened in American theatres. An American remake titled The Uninvited was released in 2009 to largely negative reviews.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 2339186, "imdb_id": "tt0365376"}
