It stars Bruce Willis and an ensemble cast comprising, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Will Patton, Peter Stormare, William Fichtner, Michael Clarke Duncan, Keith David, and Steve Buscemi.\nArmageddon opened in theaters two and a half months after the similar asteroid impact\u2013based film Deep Impact which starred T\u00e9a Leoni, Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman. Although Armageddon fared better at the box office, astronomers described Deep Impact as being more scientifically accurate.  Armageddon was an international box-office success despite generally negative reviews from critics, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 52390, "imdb_id": "tt0120591"}
