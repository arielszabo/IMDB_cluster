Most of the actors from the first film reappeared as their respective roles, including James Cromwell, Miriam Margolyes, Hugo Weaving, Danny Mann, Roscoe Lee Browne and Magda Szubanski. However, most of them have only brief appearances, as the story focuses on the journey of Babe and the farmer's wife Esme in the fictional city of Metropolis and Elizabeth Daily replaces Christine Cavanaugh as Babe.\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Song at the 1998 Academy Awards. Despite failing to match its predecessor in critial and commercial reception, Babe: Pig in the City has been recognized as a cult film since its original release.", "wiki_page_id": 573288, "imdb_id": "tt0120595"}
