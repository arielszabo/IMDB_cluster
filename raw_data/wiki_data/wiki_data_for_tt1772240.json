After various release date changes, the film was released in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada on September 2, 2011; however, the release dates for other territories vary. The film is L\u00f3pez-Gallego's first English-language movie.\nThe film's premise is that the cancelled Apollo 18 mission actually landed on the Moon in December 1974, but never returned, and as a result the United States has never launched another expedition to the Moon. The film is shot in found-footage style, supposedly \"lost footage\" of the Apollo 18 mission that was only recently discovered.\n", "wiki_page_id": 29728734, "imdb_id": "tt1772240"}
