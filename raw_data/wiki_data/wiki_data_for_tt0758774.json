{"text": "Body of Lies is a 2008 American spy thriller film directed and produced by Ridley Scott. Set in the Middle East, it follows the attempts of the CIA and Jordanian Intelligence to catch \"al-Saleem\", a terrorist. Frustrated by their target's elusiveness, differences in their approaches strain relations between a CIA operative, his superior, and the head of Jordanian Intelligence. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, and Mark Strong as the three principals. \nWilliam Monahan's screenplay, based on the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, examines contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies, and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes. The film's photography sought to emphasize the contrast between the gold and dust of the desert, and Arab cities, and the blue and gray of bureaucracy and Washington, D.C.. Accordingly, they used natural light wherever possible. Marc Streitenfeld arranged the musical score.\nScott's direction and visual style were praised by critics, but they criticized his formulaic handling of the story and use of conventions from the spy genre, such as surveillance shots from high-altitude spy planes. The film was released in the United States on October 10, 2008.\n", "wiki_page_id": 10061978, "imdb_id": "tt0758774"}
