{"text": "Billy is a fictional character from the Black Christmas films. He first appears in Bob Clark's Black Christmas (1974) as a deranged murderer who breaks into a sorority house and begins to make obscene phone calls before killing the college students one by one. In the original Black Christmas, Billy, referred to as The Prowler in the closing credits, was portrayed by Nick Mancuso and was portrayed by Robert Mann in the 2006 remake. The character was created by A. Roy Moore and has appeared in two films, a mockumentary and a novel.\nThe character is the primary antagonist in the Black Christmas film series. While the character remains ambiguous behind his identity and motivation in the original film, the remake explores the childhood of Billy. Bob Clark's intention was to never reveal what Billy looks like, so in the 1974 film, Billy's physical appearance is never shown, only showing his eye, while in the 2006 film, his appearance is fully revealed.\n", "wiki_page_id": 16249633, "imdb_id": "tt0071222"}
