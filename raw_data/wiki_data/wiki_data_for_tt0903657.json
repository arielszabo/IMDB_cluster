The film, deriving its title from the 1988 song by Wilson, stars Paul Dano and John Cusack as the young and middle-aged Wilson, respectively, with Elizabeth Banks as his second wife Melinda Ledbetter, and Paul Giamatti as his psychotherapist Dr. Eugene Landy. It also features scenes that closely recreate Wilson's recording methods for the album Pet Sounds (1966). Wilson had little involvement  with the film's development and later called  it \"very factual.\"The film premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2014 and was released by Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions on June 5, 2015. It grossed $28.6 million over a $10 million budget and received critical acclaim from reviewers; later, it was nominated for two Golden Globes: Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture (Paul Dano) and Best Original Song (\"One Kind of Love\").
