{"text": "\n\nSteve Jobs is a 2015 biographical drama film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. Based on the 2011 biography of the same name by Walter Isaacson as well as interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film is structured into three acts which cover 14 years (1984\u20131998) in the life of personal computing innovator and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, with each act taking place immediately prior to the launch of a key product \u2013 the Apple Macintosh, the NeXT Computer and the iMac. Jobs is portrayed by Michael Fassbender, with Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Jeff Daniels in supporting roles.\nDevelopment on the project began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Sorkin wrote the screenplay and filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor Elliot Graham noting that he was working on existing footage while the film was still shooting. Daniel Pemberton served as the film's composer, with a focus dedicated to dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.\nSteve Jobs premiered at the 2015 Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2015, and began a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015, to critical acclaim. Individuals close to Jobs such as Steve Wozniak and John Sculley would praise the film's performances, but the film also received criticisms for its inaccuracy in some of its scenes. Winslet won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay at the 73rd Golden Globes, while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, at the 88th Academy Awards.\n", "wiki_page_id": 44519131, "imdb_id": "tt2080374"}
