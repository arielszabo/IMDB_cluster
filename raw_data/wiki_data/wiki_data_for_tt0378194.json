{"text": "Kill Bill: Volume 2 is a 2004 American martial arts film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Uma Thurman as the Bride, who continues her campaign of revenge against the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox) and their leader Bill (David Carradine), who tried to kill her and her unborn child.\nTarantino conceived Kill Bill as a homage to \"grindhouse\" cinema including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation films, and spaghetti westerns. It is the second of two Kill Bill films produced simultaneously; the first, Kill Bill: Volume 1, was released in 2003. The films were originally set for a single release, but the film, with a runtime of over four hours, was divided in two. Like Volume 1, Volume 2 received positive reviews and was a commercial success.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 525270, "imdb_id": "tt0378194"}
