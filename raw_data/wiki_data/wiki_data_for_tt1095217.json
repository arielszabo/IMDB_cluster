{"text": "\n\nBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans is a 2009 American crime drama film directed by Werner Herzog and starring Nicolas Cage, Eva Mendes, Tom Bower, Jennifer Coolidge, Alvin 'Xzibit' Joiner, Val Kilmer, and Brad Dourif. Though the film's title resembles that of Abel Ferrara's 1992 film Bad Lieutenant; it is neither a sequel nor a remake; according to Herzog, its only commonality is a corrupt policeman as the central character. Both Bad Lieutenant films were produced by Edward R. Pressman.\nThe film premiered on September 9, 2009 at the 66th Venice International Film Festival where it won the Christopher D. Smithers Foundation Special Award for Herzog. It opened in general release in the United States on November 20, 2009.", "wiki_page_id": 18634533, "imdb_id": "tt1095217"}
