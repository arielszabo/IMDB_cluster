{"text": "\n\nMetropolis is a 1927 German expressionist science-fiction drama film directed by Fritz Lang. Written by Thea von Harbou, with collaboration from Lang himself, it starred Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge and Brigitte Helm. Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studios for Universum Film A.G. (Ufa). The silent film is regarded as a pioneering work of the science-fiction genre in movies, being among the first feature-length movies of the genre. Filming took place over 17 months in 1925\u201326 at a cost of over five million Reichsmarks.Made in Germany during the Weimar Period, Metropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city's master, and Maria, a saintly figure to the workers, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes of their city, and bring the workers together with Joh Fredersen, the master of the city. The film's message is encompassed in the final inter-title: \"The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart\".\nMetropolis was met with a mixed reception upon release. Critics found it pictorially beautiful and visually powerful\u2014the film's art direction by Otto Hunte, Erich Kettelhut and Kurt Vollbrecht draws influence from Bauhaus, Cubist and Futurist design, along with touches of the Gothic in the scenes in the catacombs, the cathedral and Rotwang's house\u2014and lauded its complex special effects, but accused its story of naivet\u00e9. H. G. Wells described the film as \"silly\", and The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction calls the film's story \"trite\" and its politics \"ludicrously simplistic\". The film's alleged Communist message was also criticized.The film's extensive running time also came in for criticism, and Metropolis was cut substantially after its German premiere, removing a large portion of Lang's original footage. Numerous attempts have been made to restore the film since the 1970s. Music producer Giorgio Moroder released a truncated version with a soundtrack by rock artists such as Freddie Mercury, Loverboy and Adam Ant in 1984. A new reconstruction of Metropolis was shown at the Berlin Film Festival in 2001. In 2008, a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. After a long restoration process that required additional materials provided by a print from New Zealand, the film was 95% restored and shown on large screens in Berlin and Frankfurt simultaneously on 12 February 2010.\nIn 2001, the film was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register, the first film thus distinguished.\n", "wiki_page_id": 49696, "imdb_id": "tt0017136"}
