{"text": "\n\nAlien Resurrection is a 1997 American science-fiction action horror film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, written by Joss Whedon, and starring Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder. It is the fourth installment in the Alien film series, and the final installment in the original series. It was filmed at the 20th Century Fox studios in Los Angeles, California.\nSet 200 years after the preceding installment Alien 3 (1992), Ellen Ripley is cloned and an Alien queen (Tom Woodruff Jr.) is surgically removed from her body. The United Systems Military hopes to breed Aliens to study and research on the spaceship USM Auriga, using human hosts kidnapped and delivered to them by a group of mercenaries. The Aliens escape their enclosures, while Ripley and the mercenaries attempt to escape and destroy the Auriga before it reaches its destination: Earth. Additional roles are played by Ron Perlman, Dan Hedaya, J. E. Freeman, Brad Dourif, and Michael Wincott.\nAlien Resurrection was released on November 26, 1997, and received mixed reviews from film critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt \"there is not a single shot in the movie to fill one with wonder\", later naming it one of the worst films of 1997, while Desson Thomson of The Washington Post said the film \"satisfactorily recycles the great surprises that made the first movie so powerful\". The film grossed $47.7 million in North America, the least successful of the Alien series on that continent. It was well received internationally, however, with a gross of $113.5 million, bringing its total gross to $161.2 million. It was the 43rd highest-grossing film in North America in 1997, eleven spots lower than Anastasia, another 20th Century Fox film.  The film was nominated for six Saturn Awards (including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actress for Weaver, Best Supporting Actress for Ryder, and Best Direction for Jeunet).\nA sequel to Resurrection was planned as Joss Whedon had written an earth-set script for Alien 5, though Sigourney Weaver was not interested in this setting, but has remained open to reprise her role as Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment on the condition that she likes the story. Although more sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series became a prequel series with the 2012 film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, who stated that the film precedes the story of Alien, but is not directly connected to the original film's franchise, and that Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.\n", "wiki_page_id": 213246, "imdb_id": "tt0118583"}
