{"text": "\n\nJules and Jim (French: Jules et Jim [\u0292yl e d\u0292im]) is a 1962 French New Wave romantic drama film, directed, produced and written by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Set around the time of World War I, it describes a tragic love triangle involving French Bohemian Jim (Henri Serre), his shy Austrian friend Jules (Oskar Werner), and Jules's girlfriend and later wife Catherine (Jeanne Moreau).\nThe film is based on Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9's 1953 semi-autobiographical novel describing his relationship with young writer Franz Hessel and Helen Grund, whom Hessel married.\nTruffaut came across the book in the mid-1950s whilst browsing through some secondhand books at a shop along the Seine in Paris. Later he befriended the elderly Roch\u00e9, who had published his first novel at the age of 74. The author approved of the young director's interest to adapt his work to another medium.\nThe film won the 1962 Grand Prix of French film prizes, the \u00c9toile de Cristal, and Jeanne Moreau won that year's prize for best actress.\nThe film ranked 46 in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010. The soundtrack by Georges Delerue was named as one of the \"10 best soundtracks\" by Time magazine in its \"All Time 100 Movies\" list.", "wiki_page_id": 2158246, "imdb_id": "tt0055032"}
