{"text": "Chasing Amy is a 1997 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Kevin Smith and starring Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, and Jason Lee. The film is about a male comic artist (Affleck) who falls in love with a lesbian/bisexual woman (Adams), to the displeasure of his best friend (Lee). It is the third film in Smith's View Askewniverse series.\nThe film was originally inspired by a brief scene from an early film by a friend of Smith's. In Guinevere Turner's Go Fish, one of the lesbian characters imagines her friends passing judgment on her for \"selling out\" by sleeping with a man. Smith was dating Adams at the time he was writing the script, which was also partly inspired by her.The film won two awards at the 1998 Independent Spirit Awards (Best Screenplay for Smith and Best Supporting Actor for Lee).\n", "wiki_page_id": 60293, "imdb_id": "tt0118842"}
