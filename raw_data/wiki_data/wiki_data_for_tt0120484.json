{"text": "The Waterboy is a 1998 American sports comedy film directed by Frank Coraci (who also appears in a cameo role), starring Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates, Fairuza Balk, Henry Winkler, Jerry Reed (his last film role before his death in 2008), Larry Gilliard, Jr., Blake Clark, Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran, and produced by Robert Simonds and Jack Giarraputo.\nLynn Swann, Lawrence Taylor, Jimmy Johnson, Bill Cowher, Paul \"The Big Show\" Wight and Rob Schneider have cameo appearances. The movie was extremely profitable, earning $161.5 million in North America alone. This was Sandler's second film to eclipse $120 million worldwide in 1998, along with The Wedding Singer.Adam Sandler's character, Bobby Boucher (pronounced  boo-SHAY), bears a strong resemblance to his \"The Excited Southerner\" comedic skits from his album What the Hell Happened to Me? The portrayal is one of a stereotypical Cajun from the bayous of South Louisiana, not the typical stereotype of a Southerner. \nHe also shares similarities in speech and mannerism to Canteen Boy, a recurring character, also portrayed by Sandler, on Saturday Night Live. Like Bobby, Canteen Boy was a soft spoken manchild who preferred \"purified water, right out of the old canteen,\" which he always carried with him.\n", "wiki_page_id": 340276, "imdb_id": "tt0120484"}
