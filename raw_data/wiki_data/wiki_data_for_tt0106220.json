{"text": "Addams Family Values is a 1993 American supernatural black comedy film, the sequel to The Addams Family (1991). It was written by Paul Rudnick and directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, and features many cast members from the original, including Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, Christina Ricci, Carel Struycken, Jimmy Workman, and Christopher Hart. Joan Cusack plays a serial killer who marries Uncle Fester (Lloyd) intending to murder him for his inheritance, while teenagers Wednesday (Ricci) and Pugsley (Workman) are sent to summer camp. Included in the soundtrack is \"Supernatural Thing\", which was a chart success for Ben E. King. \nCompared to its predecessor, which retained something of the madcap approach of the 1960s sitcom, Addams Family Values is played more for macabre laughs. The film was acclaimed by critics, receiving significantly better reviews than its predecessor, which had a mixed critical reception. It was also a commercial success, but did not perform as well at the box office as the first film.\nIt is also Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1's final theatrical film to be released in his lifetime.\n", "wiki_page_id": 876872, "imdb_id": "tt0106220"}
