{"text": "A Knight's Tale is a 2001 American medieval adventure-comedy film written, produced, and directed by Brian Helgeland. The film stars Heath Ledger, Shannyn Sossamon, Mark Addy, Alan Tudyk, Rufus Sewell, Laura Fraser, Paul Bettany as Geoffrey Chaucer, and James Purefoy as Sir Thomas Colville/Edward the Black Prince.\nThe story is told in an anachronistic style with many modern references. It follows a peasant named William who poses as a knight and competes in tournaments, winning accolades and acquiring friendships with such historical figures as Edward the Black Prince and Geoffrey Chaucer.\nThe film takes its title from Chaucer's \"The Knight's Tale\" in his The Canterbury Tales, though the plot is not similar. It was a modest success at the box office, garnering $117,487,473 with a budget of $65 million.\n", "wiki_page_id": 65669, "imdb_id": "tt0183790"}
