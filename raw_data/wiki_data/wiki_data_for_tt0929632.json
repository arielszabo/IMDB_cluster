{"text": "\n\nPrecious: Base on Nol by Saf (Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire), or simply Precious, is a 2009 American drama film, directed and co-produced by Lee Daniels. The script was written by Geoffrey S. Fletcher, adapted from the 1996 novel Push by Sapphire. The film stars Gabourey Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Paula Patton, and Mariah Carey. This film marked the acting debut of Sidibe who portrays a young woman struggling against poverty and abuse.\nThe film, then without a distributor, premiered to acclaim at both the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, under its original title of Push: Based on the Novel by Sapphire. At Sundance, it won the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize for best drama, as well as a Special Jury Prize for supporting actress Mo'Nique. After Precious' screening at Sundance in January 2009, Tyler Perry announced that he and Oprah Winfrey would be providing promotional assistance to the film, which was released through Lionsgate Entertainment. Precious won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. The film's title was changed from Push to Precious: Based on the Novel \"Push\" by Sapphire, to avoid confusion with the 2009 action film Push. Precious was also an official selection at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival (particularly the un certain regard section).\nLionsgate gave the film a limited release in North America on November 6, 2009 (the release was expanded on November 20). Precious received largely positive reviews from critics; the performances of Sidibe and Mo'Nique, the story, and its message were generally praised. In the film's opening weekend in limited release, it grossed $1.8\u00a0million, putting it in 12th place at the box office. As of February 2010, the film had grossed over $47\u00a0million domestically, ranking no. 65 for 2009, recouping its $10\u00a0million budget, and making it a box office success.Precious received six Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture, at the 82nd Academy Awards. Geoffrey Fletcher won for Best Adapted Screenplay. Mo'Nique won the award for Best Supporting Actress, for which she received a standing ovation at the ceremony, along with numerous other accolades.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 21113228, "imdb_id": "tt0929632"}
