{"text": "Wristcutters: A Love Story is a 2006 American black comedy road movie written and directed by Goran Duki\u0107 and starring Patrick Fugit, Shea Whigham, and Shannyn Sossamon. Its premise is set in a strange afterlife way-station that has been reserved for people who have died by suicide.\nIt is based on Etgar Keret's short story \"Kneller's Happy Campers\". A graphic novel version was titled Pizzeria Kamikaze.\nThe film was originally intended to be shot on super-16 color infrared film, which was produced specially by Kodak. The color-shifts inherent in using this kind of film were thought to enhance the parallel world feel to the action. In the end, it proved to be too time-consuming and the film was shot using normal filmstock manipulated in post-processing.The film was produced on an estimated budget of $1 million. Premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, it was distributed in limited release on October 19, 2007, before being expanded into wide release on November 2, 2007. It was released on DVD on March 25, 2008, courtesy of Lionsgate Home Entertainment. The film received positive reviews and has garnered a cult following.", "wiki_page_id": 5831848, "imdb_id": "tt0477139"}
