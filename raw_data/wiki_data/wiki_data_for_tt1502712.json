{"text": "\n\nFantastic Four (stylized as FANT4STIC) is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. It is the third theatrical Fantastic Four film to be produced and distributed by 20th Century Fox and a reboot of the Fantastic Four film franchise. Directed by Josh Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Slater and Simon Kinberg, the film stars Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell. In Fantastic Four, the team must learn to harness their superhuman abilities gained from an alternate universe to save Earth from a friend turned enemy.\nDevelopment of the film began in 2009 after Fox announced plans to reboot the franchise. Trank was hired to direct in July 2012 and the principal characters were cast in January 2014. Principal photography began in May 2014 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and lasted for two months. Dissatisfied with the production, Fox executives mandated reshoots, which took place in January 2015. \nFantastic Four premiered at Williamsburg Cinemas in New York City on August 4, 2015, and was released on August 7 in the United States. The film received generally unfavorable reviews by the time of its release, with criticisms aimed at its direction, screenplay, humor, gloomy tone, unfaithfulness to its source material, visual effects, choppy editing, lack of dynamic between the main characters, and pacing, though some praised the efforts of the cast; many considered the source material squandered. It was also a commercial failure, grossing $168 million worldwide against a production budget of $155 million and losing up to $100 million. At the 36th Golden Raspberry Awards, it won in the categories for Worst Director, Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel and Worst Picture (the latter tied with Fifty Shades of Grey) and was also nominated for Worst Screen Combo and Worst Screenplay.\n", "wiki_page_id": 39321638, "imdb_id": "tt1502712"}
