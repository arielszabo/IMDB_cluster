{"text": "\n\nThe Chorus (French: Les Choristes) is a 2004 European drama film directed by Christophe Barratier. Co-written by Barratier and Philippe Lopes-Curval, it is an adaptation of the 1945 film A Cage of Nightingales (La Cage aux rossignols), which in turn was adapted by No\u00ebl-No\u00ebl and Ren\u00e9 Wheeler from a story by Wheeler and Georges Chaperot. The story is based on the origins of the boy choir The Little Singers of Paris who were the main interpret in A Cage of Nightingales. The original French title translates as \"The Choristers\" or \"The Choirboys\", not \"The Chorus\".\nThe plot involves the widely successful orchestra conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin), who returns to France when his mother dies. He reminisces about his childhood inspirations when he and his former classmate P\u00e9pinot (Didier Flamand) read the diary of their old music teacher Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu (G\u00e9rard Jugnot). In 1949, a young Morhange is the badly behaved son of single mother Violette (Marie Bunel). He attends the boarding institution for \"difficult\" boys, Fond de L'\u00c9tang (\"Bottom of the Pond\"), presided over by strict headmaster Monsieur Rachin (Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and). New teacher Clement Mathieu brightens up the school and assembles a choir, leading to the discovery of Morhange's musical and physical talents and a transformation in the children.\nAt the 77th Academy Awards, The Chorus was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Song (the latter for \"Vois sur ton chemin\", listed as \"Look to Your Path\").\n", "wiki_page_id": 1204621, "imdb_id": "tt0372824"}
