It is the sequel to 2004's Shrek 2 and the third installment in the Shrek film franchise. It is also produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures, which acquired DreamWorks Pictures in 2006. Miller co-wrote the screenplay with Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, and Aron Warner. The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, and John Cleese, who reprise their voice roles from the previous film, along with new additions Justin Timberlake as Arthur Pendragon and Eric Idle as Merlin. In Shrek the Third, Prince Charming is plotting to overthrow Shrek and Fiona, who have inherited the throne following King Harold's death. Shrek, who realizes an ogre is not fit to be king, attempts to convince Fiona's underachieving, 16-year-old cousin Artie to take the reigns.\nThe film premiered at the Mann Village Theatre, Westwood in Los Angeles on May 6, 2007, and was released in the United States on May 18, 2007, exactly six years after the first film was released. The film grossed $799\u00a0million on a $160\u00a0million budget, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2007. The Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus says that it lacks the \"heart, charm, and wit\" of previous films. It was nominated for Best Animated Movie at the 2008 Kids' Choice Awards, but lost to Ratatouille. It was also nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film at the 61st British Academy Film Awards. It was the final film in the Shrek franchise to be produced by Pacific Data Images, before its closure in 2015. It was followed by a fourth film, Shrek Forever After, in 2010.\n", "wiki_page_id": 903383, "imdb_id": "tt0413267"}
