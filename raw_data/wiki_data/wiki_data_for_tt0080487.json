{"text": "\n\nCaddyshack is a 1980 American comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, written by Brian Doyle-Murray, Ramis, and Douglas Kenney, and starring Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, Michael O'Keefe and Bill Murray. Doyle-Murray also has a supporting role. The film was dedicated to producer Douglas Kenney, who died shortly after the film's release.\nCaddyshack was Ramis' directorial debut  and was a major boost to the film career of Dangerfield, who was previously known mostly for his stand-up comedy. Grossing nearly $40 million at the domestic box office (the 17th-highest of the year), it was the first of a series of similar comedies. A sequel, Caddyshack II, followed in 1988, although only Chase reprised his role and the film was poorly received.\nThe film has garnered a large cult following and has been hailed by media outlets, such as Time and ESPN, as one of the funniest sports movies ever.\n", "wiki_page_id": 217982, "imdb_id": "tt0080487"}
