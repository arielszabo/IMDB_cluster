It was written by Kazunori It\u014d and directed by Mamoru Oshii, and stars the voices of Atsuko Tanaka, Akio \u014ctsuka, and Iemasa Kayumi. Ghost in the Shell was a Japanese-British international co-production, produced by Kodansha, Bandai Visual and Manga Entertainment, with animation provided by Production I.G. \nThe plot follows Motoko Kusanagi, a public-security agent, who hunts the mysterious hacker known as the Puppet Master. The philosophical themes include self-identity in a technologically advanced world. The music, composed by Kenji Kawai, includes an ancient Japanese language.\nWidely considered one of the greatest anime films of all time, critics particularly praised the film's visuals, achieved through a combination of traditional cel animation and CGI animation. It inspired filmmakers such as the Wachowskis, creators of the Matrix films, and James Cameron. In 2004, Oshii directed Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, billed as a separate work and not a true sequel. In 2008, Oshii released an updated version of the original film, Ghost in the Shell 2.0, featuring new audio and updated 3D animation. A live-action adaptation starring Scarlett Johansson was released in 2017.\n", "wiki_page_id": 3228403, "imdb_id": "tt0113568"}
