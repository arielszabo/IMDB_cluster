{"text": "Arthur and the Invisibles (French: Arthur et les Minimoys) is a 2006 English-language French adventure comedy fantasy animated/live-action film adaptation of the 2002 children's book Arthur and the Minimoys, and the 2003 sequel Arthur and the Forbidden City, written by filmmaker Luc Besson, who also directed the film.\nIt premiered in limited release in France on November 29, 2006, and received wide releases in a number of countries in the following weeks. In the United States, it opened on December 29, 2006, for one week in Los Angeles, California, with a wider release on January 12, 2007 and it was released in the United Kingdom on February 2, 2007. With a budget of \u20ac60 million, Arthur and the Invisibles was briefly the most expensive French film production until surpassed by Ast\u00e9rix at the Olympic Games.\nThe film received negative reviews from critics, and under-performed in the United States. It was nevertheless successful enough in France and in the rest of the world to generate two sequels, Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard and Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds. The film received the Imagina Award in the category Prix du Long-M\u00e9trage. The movie's soundtrack album was released on January 9, 2007.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2554585, "imdb_id": "tt0344854"}
