The film was directed by Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman, and features the voices of Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Rainn Wilson, Paul Rudd, and Stephen Colbert.\nThe film was released on March 27, 2009 in the United States, grossing over $381 million worldwide on a $175 million budget.
