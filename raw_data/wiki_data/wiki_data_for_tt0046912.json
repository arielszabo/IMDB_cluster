{"text": "\n\nDial M for Murder is an American crime mystery film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and John Williams. Both the screenplay and the successful stage play on which it was based were written by English playwright Frederick Knott. The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television, before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October. It was filmed in 3-D with the technology that was available at the time. The World Premiere took place in Grace Kelly's hometown of Philadelphia on Tuesday, May 18, 1954 at the 2,200 seat Randolph Theater. \nAfter one preview performance on May 18 and four showings on the 19th, the manager frantically contacted the studio and said that people were staying away in droves. He asked for permission to drop the 3-D and show it flat. \nOn Sunday May 23, a Philadelphia Inquirer headline proclaimed: \"Play's the Thing as Philadelphia Fans Spurn 3-D for 2-D Version of DIAL M.\"  Mildred Martin wrote: \"The first audiences proved to be a jury that could not only make up its mind, but could make it up in a hurry. In exhibitors' own terms, DIAL M literally died. And after just four performances on Wednesday, some long-distance telephoning to report complaints, the increasing skimpiness of customers--a good many of them making no bones of their dissatisfaction--permission was given to throw away the glasses and hastily switch to the 2-D version. Whereupon business at the Randolph took a turn for the better.\"Dial M for Murder\u2032s 3D screening in February 1980 at the York Theater in San Francisco did so well that it was re-released in 3D in February 1982. The film is now available on 3D Blu-ray, marking the first time it was released on home video in its 3D presentation.\n", "wiki_page_id": 77223, "imdb_id": "tt0046912"}
