{"text": "White Noise is a 2005 supernatural horror thriller film, directed by Geoffrey Sax. The title refers to electronic voice phenomena (EVP), where voices, which some believe to be from the \"other side\", can be heard on audio recordings. The film is not related to the postmodern novel White Noise by Don DeLillo.\nThe movie did very well at the box office despite generally poor reviews from both critics and audiences. This success led Universal and other studios to realize that there was an untapped audience for horror films released in January, and began releasing higher-quality horror films during that period, usually dismissed as the winter dump months of the movie calendar.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1331578, "imdb_id": "tt0375210"}
