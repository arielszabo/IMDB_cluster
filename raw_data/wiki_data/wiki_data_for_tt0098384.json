The play and film are about the bond a group of women share in a small-town Southern community, and how they cope with the death of one of their own.\nThe story is based on Robert Harling's real life experience of the death of his sister, Susan Harling Robinson, in 1985 due to complications from Type 1 diabetes. He changed his sister's name in the story from Susan to Shelby Eatenton-Latcherie.\nThe title suggests the main female characters can be both as delicate as the magnolia flower, and as tough as steel.", "wiki_page_id": 600008, "imdb_id": "tt0098384"}
