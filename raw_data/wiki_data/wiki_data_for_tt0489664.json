The film's title is an allusion to a line of Alexander Pope's poem \"Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot\": \"Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?\" The line is usually interpreted as questioning why someone would put great effort into achieving something minor or unimportant, or who would punish a minor offender with a disproportional punishment.", "wiki_page_id": 4431129, "imdb_id": "tt0489664"}
