{"text": "\n\nSolaris (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0438\u0441, tr. Solyaris) is a 1972 Soviet science fiction film based on Stanis\u0142aw Lem's novel of the same name published in 1961. The film was co-written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The film is a meditative psychological drama occurring mostly aboard a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris. The scientific mission has stalled because the skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into separate emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin travels to the Solaris space station to evaluate the situation only to encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others.\nIn loyalty to the novel's complex and slow-paced narrative, Tarkovsky wanted to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the genre, viewing most of western science fiction as shallow. The ideas which Tarkovsky tried to express in this film are further developed in Stalker (1979).The critically successful Solaris features Natalya Bondarchuk (Hari), Donatas Banionis (Kris Kelvin), J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet (Dr. Snaut), Vladislav Dvorzhetsky (Henri Berton), Nikolai Grinko (Kris Kelvin's Father), Olga Barnet (Kris Kelvin's Mother), Anatoli Solonitsyn (Dr. Sartorius), and Sos Sargsyan (Dr. Gibarian); the music is by Johann Sebastian Bach and Eduard Artemyev. At the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, it won the Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury, the FIPRESCI prize and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. The film is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinema.\n", "wiki_page_id": 20181213, "imdb_id": "tt0069293"}
