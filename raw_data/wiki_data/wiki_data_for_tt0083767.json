{"text": "Creepshow 2 is a 1987 American live-action/animated comedy horror anthology film directed by Michael Gornick, and the sequel to Creepshow. Gornick was previously the cinematographer of the first film, and the screenplay was written by Romero who was director of the original film. It was once again based upon stories by Stephen King, and features three more horror segments consisting of Old Chief Wooden Head, The Raft and The Hitchhiker.\nUnlike the first film, Creepshow 2 only contains three stories instead of five. Originally, two additional stories, Pinfall and Cat from Hell were set to appear in the film, but were scrapped due to budgetary reasons; however, the latter has been filmed for Tales from the Darkside: The Movie. The film was Dorothy Lamour's final film before her death in 1996.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2046012, "imdb_id": "tt0083767"}
