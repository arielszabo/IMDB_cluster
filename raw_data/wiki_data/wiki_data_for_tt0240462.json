{"text": "Dr. Dolittle 2 is a 2001 American comedy film and a sequel to the 1998 film Dr. Dolittle. The film again stars Eddie Murphy in the title role of a doctor who can talk to animals, as well as Raven-Symon\u00e9 as his daughter. It was written by Larry Levin, one of the co-writers of Dr. Dolittle and directed by Steve Carr.\nIn the film, Dr. Dolittle tries to help the animals protect their forest from unscrupulous human developers. He decides to populate the forest with a species of animal that the law protects, and enlists the help of Ava (voiced by Lisa Kudrow), a lone Pacific western bear living in the condemned forest. To provide her with a mate, Dolittle turns to Archie (voiced by Steve Zahn), a wise-cracking circus-performing bear.\nThis is the last Dr. Dolittle film to feature Eddie Murphy in the lead role, before Kyla Pratt became the lead role in future films, starting with Dr. Dolittle 3 in 2006. It is also the last Dr. Dolittle film to feature Raven-Symon\u00e9 as Charisse Dolitte.\n", "wiki_page_id": 735291, "imdb_id": "tt0240462"}
