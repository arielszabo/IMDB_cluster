{"text": "Bridge to Terabithia is a 2007 American fantasy drama film directed by G\u00e1bor Csup\u00f3 and adapted for film by David L. Paterson and Jeff Stockwell. The film, starring Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, Robert Patrick, Bailee Madison, and Zooey Deschanel, and released by Walt Disney Pictures, is based on Katherine Paterson's 1977 novel of the same name. Bridge to Terabithia tells the story of Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke, 12-year-old neighbors who create a fantasy world called Terabithia and spend their free time together in an abandoned tree house.\nThe original novel was based on events from the childhood of the author's son, screenwriter David Paterson. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed in part because of his ability as a playwright. Production began in February 2006, and the film was finished by November. Principal photography was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within 60 days. Film editing took 10 weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took several months. This was Michael Chapman's last film as cinematographer before his retirement.\nBridge to Terabithia was released to positive reviews; critics called it a faithful adaptation of the children's novel, and found dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhanced the imaginative film. Bridge to Terabithia was nominated for seven awards and won five at the Young Artist Awards.\n", "wiki_page_id": 7865977, "imdb_id": "tt0398808"}
