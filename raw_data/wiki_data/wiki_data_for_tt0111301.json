{"text": "\n\nStreet Fighter is a 1994 Japanese-American action film written and directed by Steven E. de Souza, based on the Street Fighter video game series, produced by Capcom, and stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1, along with supporting performances by Byron Mann, Damian Chapa, Kylie Minogue, Ming-Na Wen and Wes Studi.\nLoosely following the plot of Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, the film focuses on the efforts of Colonel Guile (Van Damme) to bring down General M. Bison (Juli\u00e1), the military dictator and drug kingpin of Shadaloo City who aspires to conquer the world with an army of genetic supersoldiers, while enlisting the aid of street fighters Ryu (Mann) and Ken (Chapa) to infiltrate Bison's empire and help destroy it from within.\nThough a commercial success, making approximately three times its production costs, the film was not well-received by critics or fans of the games for its campy tones and use of characters. However, Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1's performance as M. Bison was widely praised and garnered him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Saturn Awards, while the film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. The film was Julia's final posthumous theatrical performance, as he died of a stroke two months before the film's release; the film is dedicated to his memory.\nA new theatrical film based on the franchise was released in 2009, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, which is unrelated to the earlier film.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1269138, "imdb_id": "tt0111301"}
