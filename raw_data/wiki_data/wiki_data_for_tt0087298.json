{"text": "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter is a 1984 American slasher film directed by Joseph Zito, produced by Frank Mancuso Jr. and starring Corey Feldman, Ted White, Kimberly Beck, and Crispin Glover. It is the fourth installment in the Friday the 13th film series. Picking up immediately after the events of Friday the 13th Part III, the story follows a presumed-dead Jason Voorhees brought to the morgue, where he spontaneously revives and escapes. He then returns to Crystal Lake to continue his killing spree, targeting a family and a group of neighboring teenagers; it is the first film to feature the character of Tommy Jarvis.\nMuch like Friday the 13th Part III, the film was originally supposed to be the final installment in the series. Mancuso Jr. wanted to conclude the series as he felt nobody respected him for his assisting work on Friday the 13th regardless of how much the films earned at the box office, as well as wanting to work on other projects. Paramount Pictures also supported the decision, as they were aware of the declining popularity of slasher films at the time of its release. As a result, the film was marketed as \"The Final Chapter\" to ensure it as such. Make-up artist Tom Savini, who worked on the first film, returned for the sequel as he wanted to help kill off Jason, who he helped create.\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released in October 1984, but Paramount pushed the date up to April 13, 1984. Upon its theatrical release, the film earned approximately $11 million on its opening weekend and grossed $32 million in the United States on a budget of $2.6 million, making it the fourth most attendance of any film in the Friday the 13th series with approximately $9,815,700 tickets sold. The film received generally negative reviews. Despite it originally set to be the final film, the success of the film prompted another sequel, Friday the 13th: A New Beginning, a year later.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2546429, "imdb_id": "tt0087298"}
