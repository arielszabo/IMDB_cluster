{"text": "\n\nCatwoman is a 2004 American superhero film very loosely based on the DC Comics character of the same name directed by Pitof, produced by Denise Di Novi and Edward McDonnell, and written by John Rogers, John Brancato and Michael Ferris, with music by Klaus Badelt. It stars Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt, Lambert Wilson, Frances Conroy, Alex Borstein, and Sharon Stone.\nAlthough Catwoman is traditionally an anti-heroine and love interest of the vigilante hero Batman, the plot features new characters and few direct references to Batman characters. In Catwoman, the meek designer Patience Phillips discovers a dark conspiracy within the cosmetics company she works for, involving a dangerous product which could cause widespread health problems. She is discovered and killed by the conspirators, but is then revived by Egyptian cats that grant her with superhuman cat-like abilities. These allow her to become a superhero crime fighter, Catwoman, so she can save humanity, while also falling in love with a police detective that pursues her.\nDevelopment of a Catwoman spin-off began in 1993 with Michelle Pfeiffer set to reprise her role as Catwoman from Batman Returns and Tim Burton attached to direct, but both dropped out.  The film labored in development hell for years until 2001, when Ashley Judd was set to play the title role, but she eventually dropped out.  Nicole Kidman was also considered for the role, until Halle Berry was chosen and production began.\nCatwoman was released in theatres on July 23, 2004, by Warner Bros. Pictures and was universally panned. The film received seven Golden Raspberry nominations and won in the categories of Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. Many considered it to be one of the worst movies of all time. The film grossed $82 million worldwide on a $100 million production budget, making it a box office bomb.\n", "wiki_page_id": 789903, "imdb_id": "tt0327554"}
