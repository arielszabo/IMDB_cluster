It questions the limits of the human mind and body while also displaying society's capacity for cruelty, and raises hope that humanity will advance to a state of better understanding. Its filming locations were around suburbs of Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Texas.\nThe film was a financial success, but critical reviews were mixed and the film's release dogged with controversy due to Salva's prior conviction for child sex abuse.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2731003, "imdb_id": "tt0114168"}
