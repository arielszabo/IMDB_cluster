{"text": "Child's Play 3 is a 1991 American slasher film and the third installment in the Child's Play film series. The film is written by Don Mancini, and directed by Jack Bender, with Brad Dourif returning as the voice of Chucky. Although released only nine months later, the story takes place eight years following the events of 1990's Child's Play 2 and one month before the events of its following installment (which was made seven years later).  It was executive produced by David Kirschner, who produced the first two Child's Play films.\nThe film became notorious in the United Kingdom when it was suggested it might have inspired the real-life murder of British child James Bulger and the murder of Suzanne Capper, suggestions rejected by officers investigating both cases. The film was followed by Bride of Chucky, Seed of Chucky, Curse of Chucky and Cult of Chucky.\n", "wiki_page_id": 534778, "imdb_id": "tt0103956"}
