{"text": "\n\nThe Avengers is a 1998 American action spy film adaptation of the British television series of the same name directed by Jeremiah Chechik. It stars Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman as secret agents John Steed and Emma Peel, and Sean Connery as Sir August de Wynter, a mad scientist bent on controlling the world's weather. Patrick Macnee, who played John Steed on the original series, makes a vocal cameo as the voice of Invisible Jones. The film was a box office bomb, only grossing $48 million of its $60 million budget, and received universally negative reviews from critics, who consider it as one of the worst films ever made.\n", "wiki_page_id": 633411, "imdb_id": "tt0118661"}
