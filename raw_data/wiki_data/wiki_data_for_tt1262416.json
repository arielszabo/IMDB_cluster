Directed by Wes Craven (his final feature film before his death in 2015) and written by Kevin Williamson (who returned to the series after writing the first two films), the film stars an ensemble cast, which includes David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Anthony Anderson, Alison Brie, Adam Brody, Rory Culkin, Marielle Jaffe, Erik Knudsen, Mary McDonnell, Marley Shelton and Nico Tortorella. The plot involves Sidney Prescott returning to Woodsboro after ten years, as part of her book tour. As soon as she arrives, Ghostface once again begins killing students from Woodsboro High.\nOriginally, the series was intended to be a trilogy, but film production for a fourth installment was approved by Bob Weinstein. Filming took place in and around Ann Arbor, Michigan, from June 2010 to September 2010, with re-shoots in early 2011.\nScream 4 was released on April 15, 2011 and grossed $97 million against its $40 million budget.
