{"text": "\n\nJaws: The Revenge is a 1987 American horror thriller film produced and directed by Joseph Sargent, and starring Lorraine Gary, Lance Guest, Mario Van Peebles and Michael Caine. It is the third sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws and the fourth and final installment in the Jaws franchise. It was the final theatrical film to be directed by Sargent.\nThe film focuses on a now-widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) and her convictions that a great white shark is seeking revenge on her family, particularly when it kills her son and follows her to the Bahamas. Jaws: The Revenge was shot on location in New England and in the Bahamas, and completed on the Universal lot. Like the first two films, Martha's Vineyard was the location of the fictional Amity Island for the opening scenes. Although preceded by Jaws 3-D, The Revenge ignores plot elements introduced in that film.\nJaws: The Revenge received negative reviews from film critics. While production of the other three films in the series took around two years for each film, Jaws: The Revenge was made in less than nine months. According to associate producer and production manager Frank Baur during the sequel's filming, \"This (Revenge) will be the fastest I have ever seen a major film planned and executed in all of my 35 years as a production manager.\" \nThe film was nominated for seven Golden Raspberry Awards, and won one.\n", "wiki_page_id": 529276, "imdb_id": "tt0093300"}
