{"text": "\n\nFlightplan is a 2005 psychological thriller mystery film directed by Robert Schwentke, written by Peter A. Dowling and Billy Ray, and starring Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Erika Christensen, Kate Beahan, Greta Scacchi, Sean Bean, and Matt Bomer (in his film debut). A co-production of United States and Germany, the film's narrative follows Kyle Pratt, a widowed American aircraft engineer living in Berlin, who flies back to the U.S with her daughter and her husband's body only to lose her daughter during the flight and must struggle to find her while proving her sanity at the same time. The plot's basic premise (albeit with a very different denouement) is similar to a 1955 episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents titled, \"Into Thin Air\", as well as Hitchcock's 1938 film The Lady Vanishes. It is also reminiscent of the 1950 British film So Long at the Fair.\nFlightplan was distributed by Touchstone Pictures and was released worldwide theatrically on September 23, 2005. Upon release the film received mixed reviews from critics who acclaimed the performances of its cast but found the screenplay less competent. The film was a major commercial success grossing over $223 million on a budget of $50 million.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2008863, "imdb_id": "tt0408790"}
