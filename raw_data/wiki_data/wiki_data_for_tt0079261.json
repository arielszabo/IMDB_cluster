{"text": "\n\nJan Tom\u00e1\u0161 \"Milo\u0161\" Forman (Czech: [\u02c8m\u026alo\u0283 \u02c8forman]; 18 February 1932 \u2013 13 April 2018) was a Czech American film director, screenwriter, actor and professor who, until 1968, lived and worked primarily in the former Czechoslovakia. \nForman was an important component of the Czechoslovak New Wave. His 1967 film The Firemen's Ball, on the surface a naturalistic representation of an ill-fated social event in a provincial town, was seen by both film scholars and authorities in Czechoslovakia as a biting satire on Eastern European Communism. As a result, it was banned for many years in Forman's home country.\nAfter Forman left Czechoslovakia for the United States, two of his films, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984), acquired particular renown, and both gained him an Academy Award for Best Director. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest became the second film to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Actor in Leading Role, Actress in Leading Role, Director, and Screenplay) after It Happened One Night in 1934\u2014an accomplishment not repeated until 1991, by The Silence of the Lambs. \nForman was also nominated for a Best Director Oscar for The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). He also won Golden Globe, Cannes, Berlinale, BAFTA, Cesar, David di Donatello, European Film Academy, and Czech Lion awards.", "wiki_page_id": 51333, "imdb_id": "tt0079261"}
