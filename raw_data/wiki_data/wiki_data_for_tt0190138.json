{"text": "The Whole Nine Yards is a 2000 American crime comedy film directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Amanda Peet, Michael Clarke Duncan and Natasha Henstridge. The title derives from a popular expression of uncertain origin (but which may derive from a saying analogous to \"the whole kit and kaboodle\"--the lengthiest entirety of a measure of silk fabric from which an Indian Sari is made). A sequel, The Whole Ten Yards, was released in 2004.\n", "wiki_page_id": 6446995, "imdb_id": "tt0190138"}
