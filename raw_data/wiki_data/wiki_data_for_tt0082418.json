{"text": "Friday the 13th Part 2 (marketed as Friday the 13th Part II) is a 1981 American slasher film  produced and directed by Steve Miner in his directorial debut, and the second installment in the Friday the 13th film series. It is a direct sequel to Friday the 13th, picking up five years after that film's conclusion, where a new murderer stalks and begins murdering the camp counselors at a nearby training camp in Crystal Lake. The film marks the first time Jason Voorhees is the killer; his mother was the killer in the previous film. It also features the brief return of Alice Hardy, who is currently the only Friday the 13th heroine to return in a sequel.\nOriginally, Friday the 13th Part 2 was not intended to be a direct sequel but rather part of an anthology series of films based on the Friday the 13th superstition; however, after the popularity of the original film's surprise ending where Jason Voorhees attacks the heroine, the filmmakers opted to revive Jason and the mythology surrounding Camp Crystal Lake, a trend which would be repeated in the following films.  \nLike the original film, Friday the 13th Part 2 faced opposition from the Motion Picture Association of America, who noted its \"accumulative violence\" as problematic, resulting in numerous cuts being made to allow an R rating. The film was released theatrically in North America on April 30, 1981. Although it did not gross as much as the original and still received negative reviews, the sequel grossed over $21.7 million in the United States on a budget of $1.25 million.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2274938, "imdb_id": "tt0082418"}
