A bildungsroman that follows its protagonist's transition into adulthood, the film tells the story of 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a recent college graduate with no well-defined aim in life, who is seduced by an older woman, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), and then falls in love with her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross).\nThe film was released on December 22, 1967, received positive reviews and grossed $104.9 million in the U.S. and Canada.

When AFI revised the list in 2007, the film was moved to number 17.
