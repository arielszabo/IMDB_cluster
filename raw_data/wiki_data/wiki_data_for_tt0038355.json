{"text": "The Big Sleep is a 1946 film noir directed by Howard Hawks, the first film version of Raymond Chandler's 1939 novel of the same name. The film stars Humphrey Bogart as private detective Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as Vivian Rutledge in a story about the \"process of a criminal investigation, not its results.\" William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay.\nA remake starring Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe was released in 1978. This was the second film in three years featuring Mitchum as Marlowe. The remake was arguably more faithful to the novel, possibly due to fewer restrictions in 1978 on what could be portrayed on screen, however, it was far less successful than the original 1946 version. In 1997, the U.S. Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant,\" and added it to the National Film Registry.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1645598, "imdb_id": "tt0038355"}
