{"text": "Cube 2: Hypercube (stylized as Cube2: Hypercube in the film) is a 2002 Canadian independent science fiction horror film, directed by Andrzej Seku\u0142a, written by Sean Hood, and produced by Ernie Barbarash, Peter Block, and Suzanne Colvin. It is the second film in the Cube film series, and a sequel to Cube.\nReleased in 2002, in Hypercube, the industrial-style, colored rooms of the first film are replaced with high-tech, brightly lit chambers; instead of traps such as flamethrowers and extending spikes, the rooms have \"evolved\", as they control illusions, time, space, and reality.\nThe film's critical reception was mixed, with reviewers panning the sequel's poorly-produced CGI, writing, and production, but praising its evolution upon the first film, and its acting and suspense.\n", "wiki_page_id": 922861, "imdb_id": "tt0285492"}
