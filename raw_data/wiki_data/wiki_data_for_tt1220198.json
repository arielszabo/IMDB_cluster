{"text": "The Fourth Kind is a 2009 American science fiction thriller film directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi and featuring a cast of Milla Jovovich, Elias Koteas, Corey Johnson, Will Patton, Charlotte Milchard, Mia Mckenna-Bruce, Yulian Vergov, and Olatunde Osunsanmi. The title is derived from the expansion of J. Allen Hynek's classification of close encounters with aliens, in which the fourth kind denotes alien abductions.\nThe film is a pseudodocumentary purporting to be based on real events occurring in Nome, Alaska in 2000, in which psychologist Dr. Abigail Emily \"Abbey\" Tyler uses hypnosis to uncover memories from her patients of alien abduction, and finds evidence suggesting that she may have been abducted as well. The film has two components: dramatization, in which actors portray the individuals involved, and \"documentary\", in which video footage purports to show the 'actual' victims undergoing hypnosis. Throughout the film, Abbey, played by Charlotte Milchard, is shown purportedly being interviewed on television in 2002, two years after the abductions occurred. At some points in the film, the \"documentary\" and dramatized footage are presented alongside each other in split-screen.The film was largely panned by critics but made US$47.71\u00a0million in cinemas worldwide.", "wiki_page_id": 23992760, "imdb_id": "tt1220198"}
