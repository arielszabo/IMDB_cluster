{"text": "Lady in the Water is a 2006 American fantasy drama film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starring Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard. The film's plot concerns the superintendent of a Philadelphia apartment complex who discovers a young woman in the swimming pool. Gradually, he and his neighbors learn that she is a water nymph (or Narf) whose life is in danger from a vicious, wolf-like, mystical creature called a Scrunt that tries to keep her from returning to her watery \"blue world\". This is Shyamalan's first movie in which he played a significant role as one of the supporting actors.\nThe film received a negative response from critics, with criticism revolving around the self-indulgence with which Shayamalan cast himself in the film, the lack of consistency and characterization. The film was also a financial disappointment grossing merely $72 million against a $70 million production budget.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1644192, "imdb_id": "tt0452637"}
