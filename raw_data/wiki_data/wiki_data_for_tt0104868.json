It was the first film in The Mighty Ducks film series, and was filmed in several locations in Minnesota.In the UK, South Africa, and Australia, the film was retitled Champions. Subsequently, UK home releases are now titled The Mighty Ducks Are the Champions, reflecting both titles, as well as to possibly avoid confusion with D2: The Mighty Ducks (retitled as just The Mighty Ducks). The year after the film's release, Disney founded a National Hockey League hockey team, named the \"Mighty Ducks of Anaheim\" after the film.\n", "wiki_page_id": 552592, "imdb_id": "tt0104868"}
