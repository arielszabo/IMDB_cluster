{"text": "Papillon is a 1973 historical period drama prison film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. The screenplay by Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr. was based on the 1969 autobiography by the French convict Henri Charri\u00e8re. The film stars Steve McQueen as Henri Charri\u00e8re (\"Papillon\") and Dustin Hoffman as Louis Dega. Because it was filmed at remote locations, the film was quite expensive for the time ($12 million), but it earned more than twice that in its first year of release. The film's title is French for \"Butterfly,\" referring to Charri\u00e8re's tattoo and nickname.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 872386, "imdb_id": "tt0070511"}
