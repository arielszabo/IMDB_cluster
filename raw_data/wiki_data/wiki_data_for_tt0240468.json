{"text": "\n\nKung Pow! Enter the Fist is a 2002 American martial arts comedy film that parodies Hong Kong action cinema. Written, directed by and starring Steve Oedekerk, it uses footage from the 1976 Hong Kong martial arts film Tiger & Crane Fists (also called Savage Killers), along with new footage shot by Oedekerk, to create an original, unrelated plot.\nThe film was a moderate box office success, grossing $17 million worldwide, and received largely negative critical reviews but has become a cult film. A sequel, to be written and directed by Oedekerk, was announced in 2015.", "wiki_page_id": 1095555, "imdb_id": "tt0240468"}
