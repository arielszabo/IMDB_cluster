{"text": "\n\nEpic Movie is a 2007 American comedy film directed and written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and produced by Paul Schiff. It was made in a similar style to Date Movie, Friedberg and Seltzer's previous film, but as a spoof of the \"Epic\" style of films, hence the name. The film mostly references The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the Harry Potter films, Tim Burton's version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Pirates of the Caribbean, and X-Men: The Last Stand. The song \"Ms. New Booty\" by Bubba Sparxxx gained commercial attention for being featured in Epic Movie.\n", "wiki_page_id": 7892732, "imdb_id": "tt0799949"}
