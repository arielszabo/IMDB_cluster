{"text": "Cujo is a 1983 American horror film based on Stephen King's 1981 novel of the same name and directed by Lewis Teague. It was written by Don Carlos Dunaway and Barbara Turner (using the pen name Lauren Currier), and starring Dee Wallace, Daniel Hugh Kelly and Danny Pintauro. The film revolves around a rabid St. Bernard dog, who traps a mother and her child inside their car without food or water during a heat wave, and their attempts to survive.\nDespite receiving mixed reviews and being a modest success during its theatrical release, the film has gathered a major cult following in the years since its release. Another film adaptation was announced in 2015 and is currently in production.\n", "wiki_page_id": 13235461, "imdb_id": "tt0085382"}
