{"text": "\n\nStar Trek: Nemesis is a 2002 American science fiction film directed by Stuart Baird and based on the franchise of the same name created by Gene Roddenberry. It is the tenth film in the Star Trek film series, as well as the fourth and last to star the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was written by John Logan from a story developed by Logan, Brent Spiner, and producer Rick Berman. In the film, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E are forced to deal with a threat to the United Federation of Planets from a Reman clone of Captain Picard named Shinzon, who has taken control of the Romulan Star Empire in a coup d'\u00e9tat.\nPrincipal photography for the film took place from November 2001 to March 2002. Jerry Goldsmith composed the film's score. The film was released in North America on December 13, 2002, by Paramount Pictures, and received generally mixed reviews, with publications criticizing it for being the least successful in the Star Trek franchise. The film went on to earn $67 million worldwide, making it a box office disappointment. Following the failure of the film and the cancellation of Star Trek: Enterprise, Berman and Erik Jendresen began development on the unproduced Star Trek: The Beginning. Three years later, Viacom split from CBS Corporation, and Paramount eventually rebooted the film series in 2009 with Star Trek, directed by J. J. Abrams.\n", "wiki_page_id": 156774, "imdb_id": "tt0253754"}
