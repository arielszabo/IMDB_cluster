{"text": "\n\nKahaani (IPA:\u00a0[k\u0259\u02c8\u0266a\u02d0ni]; lit.\u2009Story) is a 2012 Indian Hindi-language mystery thriller film co-written, co-produced and directed by Sujoy Ghosh. It stars Vidya Balan as Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman searching for her missing husband in Kolkata during the festival of Durga Puja, assisted by Satyoki \"Rana\" Sinha (Parambrata Chatterjee) and Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui).\nMade on a shoestring budget of \u20b980 million (US$1.1\u00a0million), Kahaani was conceived and developed by Ghosh, who co-wrote the film with Advaita Kala. The crew often employed guerrilla-filmmaking techniques on Kolkata's city streets to avoid attracting attention. The film was noted for its deft portrayal of the city and for making use of many local crew and cast members. Kahaani explores themes of feminism and motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to Satyajit Ray's films such as Charulata (1964), Aranyer Dinratri (1970) and Joi Baba Felunath (1979).\nKahaani was released worldwide on 9 March 2012. Critics praised the screenplay, the cinematography and the performances of the lead actors. Following critical acclaim and word-of-mouth publicity, the film earned \u20b91.04 billion (US$14\u00a0million) worldwide in 50 days. The film won several awards, including three National Film Awards and five Filmfare Awards. The latter included trophies for Best Director (Ghosh) and Best Actress (Vidya). A sequel, titled Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh, was released on 2 December 2016.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 15316430, "imdb_id": "tt1821480"}
