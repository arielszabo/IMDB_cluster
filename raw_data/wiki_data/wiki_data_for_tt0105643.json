{"text": "Troll 2 is a 1990 horror comedy film directed by Claudio Fragasso (under the pseudonym Drake Floyd) and starring Michael Stephenson, George Hardy, Margo Prey, Connie McFarland, Deborah Reed and Jason Wright. The plot concerns a family pursued by vegetarian goblins who seek to transform them into plants so that they can eat them.\nAlthough produced under the title Goblins, United States distributors were skeptical about the film's chances to succeed as an indie film and renamed it Troll 2 in an attempt to market it as a sequel to the 1986 Empire Pictures film Troll. The two films, however, have no connection, and no trolls are actually depicted in Troll 2. The film's production was rife with difficulties, largely revolving around the language barrier between the Italian-speaking crew and English-speaking cast, and producer Joe D'Amato's approach to low-budget film making. The resulting film has come to be evaluated as one of the worst ever made.\nIn subsequent years, the film gained a cult following and garnered a large fanbase. In 2009, Stephenson, the child star of the film, directed a critically acclaimed documentary about its production and subsequent popularity, humorously titled Best Worst Movie.", "wiki_page_id": 2786477, "imdb_id": "tt0105643"}
