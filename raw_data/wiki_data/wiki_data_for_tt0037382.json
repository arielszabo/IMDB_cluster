{"text": "\n\nTo Have and Have Not is a 1944 American romance-war-adventure film directed by Howard Hawks, and produced by Hawks and Jack L. Warner. Written by Jules Furthman and William Faulkner, the screenplay is based on Ernest Hemingway's 1937 novel of the same name. The film represents the only film story on which two winners of the Nobel Prize of Literature worked. However, the story was altered for the film. It stars Humphrey Bogart, Walter Brennan and Lauren Bacall in her film debut. The plot centers on the romance between a freelancing fisherman in Martinique and a beautiful American drifter which is complicated by the growing French resistance in Vichy France. The film was originally set in Cuba, but the location was changed due to concerns with the Office of Coordinator of Inter American Affairs during World War II.\nAudience reception of the film was generally good, with most film critics stating that the film was a remake of Casablanca (1942), either stating that it was acceptable or poor. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall fell in love during the production of the movie, and would marry in 1945 after the film's release. To Have and Have Not was one of the top thirty grossing films in 1944 and it received an award from the National Board of Review.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1971307, "imdb_id": "tt0037382"}
