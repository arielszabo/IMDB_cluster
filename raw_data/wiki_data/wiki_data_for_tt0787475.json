{"text": "Hot Rod is a 2007 American comedy film co-written, directed by, and starring members of The Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer). The film stars Samberg as amateur stuntman Rod Kimble, whose step-father, Frank (Ian McShane) continuously mocks and disrespects him. When Frank becomes ill, Rod raises money for his heart operation by executing his largest stunt yet. In addition to raising money for the operation, he also does so to win Frank's respect, by kicking his butt. The film also stars Taccone, Sissy Spacek, Will Arnett, Danny McBride, Isla Fisher and Bill Hader. It was directed by Schaffer (in his directorial debut) and distributed by Paramount Pictures.\nThe film was originally drafted by Pam Brady (who retains full writing credit) as a vehicle for Saturday Night Live star Will Ferrell, but the project never commenced. Lorne Michaels convinced Paramount to let The Lonely Island, who were growing famous for their work on SNL, take over the film. The group subsequently re-wrote the film with a heavy emphasis on offbeat surreal humor. The film was shot in Vancouver over the summer of 2006. The film's soundtrack was composed by ex-Yes guitarist, Trevor Rabin, and the film features several songs by the Swedish rock band Europe.\nHot Rod opened on August 3, 2007 and was a box office failure, grossing only $14 million of its $25 million budget. As the film's producers predicted, it received mixed reviews, with critics criticizing the film's script and humor. It has become a moderate cult film on home media.\n", "wiki_page_id": 6937139, "imdb_id": "tt0787475"}
