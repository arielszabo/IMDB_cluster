{"text": "\n\nApocalypto is a 2006 American epic adventure film directed and produced by Mel Gibson and written by Gibson and Farhad Safinia. The film features a cast of Native American and Indigenous Mexican actors consisting of Rudy Youngblood, Raoul Trujillo, Mayra S\u00e9rbulo, Dalia Hern\u00e1ndez, Ian Uriel, Gerardo Taracena, Rodolfo Palacios, Bernardo Ruiz Juarez, Ammel Rodrigo Mendoza, Ricardo Diaz Mendoza and Israel Contreras. Similar to Gibson's earlier film The Passion of the Christ, all dialogue is in a modern approximation of the ancient language of the setting. Here, the Indigenous Yucatec Maya language is spoken, with subtitles, which sometimes refer to the language as Mayan. This was the last film Gibson directed until 2016's Hacksaw Ridge ten years later.\nSet in Veracruz, Los Tuxtla around the year 1511, Apocalypto depicts the journey of Jaguar Paw, a Mesoamerican hunter and his fellow tribesmen captured by an invading force after the destruction of their village who must escape human sacrifice at a time when the Maya civilization is about to come to an end. The film was a box office success, grossing over $120 million worldwide, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising Gibson's direction, Dean Semler's cinematography, the performances of the cast, and the portrayal of Mayan civilization.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 2308701, "imdb_id": "tt0472043"}
