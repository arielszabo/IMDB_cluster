{"text": "Sweet and Lowdown is a 1999 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Woody Allen. Loosely based on Federico Fellini's film La Strada, the film tells the fictional story, set in the 1930s, of a self-confident jazz guitarist Emmet Ray (played by Sean Penn) who falls in love with a mute woman (Samantha Morton). The film also stars Uma Thurman and Anthony LaPaglia. Like several of Allen's other films (e.g., Zelig), the film is occasionally interrupted by interviews with critics and biographers like Allen, Nat Hentoff, and Douglas McGrath, who comment on the film's plot as if the characters were real-life people.\nThe film is one of the better-received later works by Allen. Penn and Morton both received Oscar nominations, for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.\n", "wiki_page_id": 171588, "imdb_id": "tt0158371"}
