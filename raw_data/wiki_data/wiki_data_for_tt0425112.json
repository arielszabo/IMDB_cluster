{"text": "\n\nHot Fuzz is a 2007 buddy cop action comedy film directed by Edgar Wright, written by Wright and Simon Pegg, and starring Pegg and Nick Frost. The three and the film's producer Nira Park had previously worked together on the television series Spaced and the 2004 film Shaun of the Dead. Pegg and Frost play police officers attempting to solve a series of mysterious deaths in Sandford, a village in the West Country.\nOver a hundred action films were used as inspiration for developing the script. Filming took place over eleven weeks in early 2006, and featured an extensive cast along with various uncredited cameos. Visual effects were developed by ten artists to expand on or add explosions, gore, and gunfire scenes. The film debuted on 14 February 2007 in the United Kingdom and 20 April in the United States, grossing US$80 million worldwide. Two different soundtracks were released in the UK and US.\nThe film is the second in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy and was preceded by 2004's Shaun of the Dead and followed by 2013's The World's End, each of them featuring a different flavour of Cornetto ice cream. It is also the most financially successful film in the trilogy.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 3006708, "imdb_id": "tt0425112"}
