{"text": "Hudson Hawk is a 1991 American action comedy film directed by Michael Lehmann. Bruce Willis stars in the title role and also co-wrote both the story and the theme song. Danny Aiello, Andie MacDowell, James Coburn, David Caruso, Lorraine Toussaint, Frank Stallone, Sandra Bernhard, and Richard E. Grant are also featured. It was a box office bomb, losing the studio nearly $50 million.The live action film employs cartoon-style slapstick heavily, including sound effects, which enhances the movie's signature surreal humour. The plot combines material based on conspiracy theories, secret societies, and historic mysteries, as well as outlandish \"clockpunk\" technology \u00e0 la Coburn's Our Man Flint movies of the 1960s.A recurring plot device in the film has Hudson and his partner Tommy \"Five-Tone\" (Aiello) singing songs concurrently but separately, to time and synchronize their exploits. Willis-Aiello duets of Bing Crosby's \"Swinging on a Star\" and Paul Anka's \"Side by Side\" are featured on the film's soundtrack.\n", "wiki_page_id": 100274, "imdb_id": "tt0102070"}
