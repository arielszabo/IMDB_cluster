{"text": "Sofia Carmina Coppola ( KOH-p\u0259-l\u0259; born May 14, 1971) is an American screenwriter, director, producer, and former actress.\nShe is the daughter of director, producer, and screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola, and made her film debut as an infant in her father's acclaimed crime drama film, The Godfather (1972). She later appeared in a supporting role in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986) and portrayed Mary Corleone, the daughter of Michael Corleone, in The Godfather: Part III (1990). The latter film earned her much derision and critical backlash, effectively ending her acting career. Coppola then turned her attention to filmmaking.\nShe made her feature-length debut with the coming-of-age drama The Virgin Suicides (1999), based on the novel of the same name by Jeffery Eugenides. It was the first of her collaborations with actress Kirsten Dunst. In 2003, she received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the comedy-drama Lost in Translation and became the third woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director. In 2006, Coppola directed the historical drama Marie Antoinette, starring Dunst as the ill-fated French queen. In 2010, with the drama Somewhere, Coppola became the first American woman (and fourth American filmmaker) to win the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. In 2013, she directed the satirical crime film The Bling Ring, based on the crime ring of the same name.\nAt the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, Coppola became the second woman (and the first American woman) in the festival's history to win the Best Director award, for the drama film The Beguiled.", "wiki_page_id": 361020, "imdb_id": "tt0091738"}
