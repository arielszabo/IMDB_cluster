{"text": "Tsui Hark (Chinese: \u5f90\u514b, Vietnamese: T\u1eeb Kh\u1eafc, born 15 February 1950), born Tsui Man-kong, is a Vietnam-born Chinese film director, producer and screenwriter. Tsui has directed several influential Hong Kong films such as Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain (1983), the Once Upon a Time in China film series (1991-1997) and The Blade (1995), and also was a prolific writer and producer, whose other works include A Better Tomorrow (1986), A Chinese Ghost Story (1987),  and The Killer (1989). He is viewed as a major figure in the Golden Age of Hong Kong cinema and has been regarded by critics as \"one of the masters of Asian cinematography.\"In the late 1990s, Tsui had a short-lived career in the United States, directing the Jean-Claude Van Damme-led films Double Team (1997) and Knock Off (1998). Both films were commercially unsuccessful and critically panned; Tsui himself was unsatisfied with his lack of creative control, and returned to Hong Kong for the rest of his career. He has since found new commercial and critical success with blockbusters such as the Detective Dee film series (2010\u2013present),  Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011) and The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014).\n", "wiki_page_id": 100385, "imdb_id": "tt0119013"}
