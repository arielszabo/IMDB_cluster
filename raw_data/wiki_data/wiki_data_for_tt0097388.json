{"text": "Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan is a 1989 American slasher film written and directed by Rob Hedden, and starring Jensen Daggett, Scott Reeves, Peter Mark Richman, and Kane Hodder. It is the eighth installment in the Friday the 13th film series and follows Jason Voorhees stalking a group of high school graduates on a ship en route to, and later in, New York City. It was the last film in the series to be distributed by Paramount Pictures in the United States until 2009, with the subsequent installments being distributed by New Line Cinema. \nThe film, like several of its predecessors, was intended to be the final film in the series. Filming took place primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia, with additional photography in New York City's Times Square and in Los Angeles. At the time of its production, Jason Takes Manhattan was the most expensive film in the series, with a budget of around $5 million. It received substantial attention for its initial marketing campaign, featuring Jason Voorhees slashing through the \"I Love New York\" logo with a knife, which was later retracted after the New York City Tourism committee filed a complaint against Paramount Pictures. \nReleased on July 28, 1989, the film grossed $14.3 million at the U.S. box office, which was the second-lowest U.S. gross in the series. The film received both criticism and praise from critics for its implementation of humor, while others deemed it the worst film in the series thus far. It was followed by Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday, released in 1993.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2351932, "imdb_id": "tt0097388"}
