{"text": "\n\nEighth Grade is a 2018 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Bo Burnham, in his feature film directorial debut. The plot follows the life and struggles of an eighth-grader, played by Elsie Fisher, during her last week of classes before embarking for high school. She struggles with anxiety in social situations but produces video blogs giving life advice.\nBurnham was inspired by his own struggles with anxiety when he began writing the screenplay in 2014. He had difficulty finding funding for the project until 2016, with shooting beginning in Suffern, New York in summer 2017. Fisher was cast after Burnham noticed her on YouTube; she led a cast including Josh Hamilton and Emily Robinson. Themes include heavy use of social media, mental health in Generation Z and sexuality and consent.\nThe film premiered on January 19, as part of the U.S. Dramatic Competition section of the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. After other festival screenings, it was theatrically released in the United States by A24 on July 13, 2018. Its R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America inspired criticism, as the MPAA's decision would have blocked many eighth-grade viewers from seeing the film. In response, the distributors arranged free, unrated screenings across the U.S. Eighth Grade received acclaim from critics, with praise for Burnham's script and direction and Fisher's performance. It won numerous film festival awards.\n", "wiki_page_id": 56186449, "imdb_id": "tt7014006"}
