{"text": "\n\nSuperhero Movie is a 2008 American superhero comedy film written and directed by Craig Mazin, produced by Robert K. Weiss and David Zucker, and starring Drake Bell, Sara Paxton, Christopher McDonald, and Leslie Nielsen. It was originally titled Superhero! as a nod to one of the Zuckers' previous films, Airplane!, in which Nielsen also starred. \nA spoof of the superhero film genre, primarily the first Spider-Man, as well as other modern-day Marvel Comics film adaptations, the film follows in the footsteps of the Scary Movie series of comedies, with which the film's poster shares a resemblance. It was also inspired by, and contains homages to, some of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's earlier spoof films such as Airplane! and The Naked Gun.\nProduction began on September 17, 2007, in New York. It was released on March 28, 2008 in the United States to generally negative reviews from critics (but more positive than earlier entries such as Date Movie and Meet the Spartans), but received a moderate box office success, grossing over $71 million worldwide, and it gained a cult following.\n", "wiki_page_id": 13364985, "imdb_id": "tt0426592"}
