{"text": "\n\nDracula Untold is a 2014 American dark fantasy action horror film directed by Gary Shore in his feature film debut and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.

Luke Evans portrays the title character, and Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson, and Charles Dance appear in supporting roles.\nPrincipal photography began in Northern Ireland on August 5, 2013. Universal Pictures released the film in regular and IMAX cinemas on October 10, 2014.\nDespite being a box office success, grossing $217 million worldwide, Dracula Untold received negative critical reviews, with praise for Luke Evans's performance and the story, and criticism of the characterization.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 39358996, "imdb_id": "tt0829150"}
