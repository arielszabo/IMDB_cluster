{"text": "The Lawnmower Man is a 1992 science-fiction action-horror film directed by Brett Leonard and written by Brett Leonard and Gimel Everett. The movie is supposedly an adaptation of Stephen King short story of the same name, but aside from a single scene, the two are completely different. The film stars Jeff Fahey as Jobe Smith, a simple-minded gardener, and Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, the scientist who decides to experiment on him.\nThe film was originally titled Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man, but King successfully sued the producers for attaching his name to the film and stated in court documents that the film \"bore no meaningful resemblance\" to his story. An earlier short film, also titled The Lawnmower Man, is a more faithful adaptation of the short story. It was directed by Jim Gonis in 1987.A sequel, Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace, was released in 1996, with Austin O'Brien as the only returning actor from the original film.\n", "wiki_page_id": 672934, "imdb_id": "tt0104692"}
