{"text": "\n\nMoonrise Kingdom is a 2012 American coming-of-age film directed by Wes Anderson, written by Anderson and Roman Coppola. It features newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward leading a cast including Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, and Bob Balaban. It is about a young orphan (Gilman) who escapes from a scouting camp on an island to unite with his pen pal, a girl (Hayward) with aggressive tendencies. Feeling shunned by everyone around them for their disturbed behaviors, the two lovers retreat to an isolated beach they call Moonrise Kingdom, while the scouts, police and family members launch a search party to retrieve them.\nAnderson and Coppola drew on personal experiences and memories of childhood fantasies in crafting their screenplay, which also took inspiration from earlier films like Melody (1971) and The 400 Blows (1959). The filmmakers invented maps for the fictional island setting. They also took eight months auditioning child actors before selecting Hayward and Gilman. Filming took place in Rhode Island in 2011. Critics noted Moonrise Kingdom's colorful style and the use of symmetry in its photography, combined with a soundtrack making use of the music of Benjamin Britten with original compositions by Alexandre Desplat.\nThe film premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim. Film scholars observed themes of young love, child sexuality, juvenile mental health and family break-up, with allusions to the Genesis flood narrative. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy. In 2016, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) included the film in its list of the 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.\n", "wiki_page_id": 31462588, "imdb_id": "tt1748122"}
