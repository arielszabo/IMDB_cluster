{"text": "Deliverance is a 1972 American thriller film produced and directed by John Boorman, and starring Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox, with the latter two making their feature film debuts. The film is based on the 1970 novel of the same name by author James Dickey, a celebrated poet who has a small role in the film as the sheriff, and who wrote the screenplay with an uncredited Boorman. The film was a critical success, earning three Academy Award nominations and five Golden Globe nominations.\nWidely acclaimed as a landmark picture, the film is noted for a music scene near the beginning, with one of the city men playing \"Dueling Banjos\" on guitar with a banjo-strumming country boy, that sets the tone for what lies ahead, a trip into unknown and potentially dangerous wilderness; and for its visceral and notorious male rape scene. In 2008, Deliverance was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n", "wiki_page_id": 101899, "imdb_id": "tt0068473"}
