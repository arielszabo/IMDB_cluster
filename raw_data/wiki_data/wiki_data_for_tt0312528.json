{"text": "\n\nThe Cat in the Hat (also known as Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat) is a 2003 American fantasy comedy film directed by Bo Welch in his directorial debut and based on Dr. Seuss\u2019s book of the same name. Starring Mike Myers, Dakota Fanning, Spencer Breslin, Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston, it is the second feature-length Dr. Seuss adaptation after the 2000 film How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\nThe idea was originally conceived in 2001 with Tim Allen initially cast as the Cat, but he dropped his role due to work on The Santa Clause 2 and the role was later given to Myers. Filming took place in California for three months. While the basic plot parallels that of the book, the film filled out its 82 minutes by adding new subplots and characters significantly different from the original story similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\nReleased theatrically on November 21, 2003 in the United States, the film grossed $134 million worldwide against a budget of $109 million  but was panned by critics largely for its family-unfriendly humor and innuendos while the visual aspects were mostly praised. Following the film's release, Seuss' widow, Audrey Geisel, decided not to allow any further live-action adaptations of Seuss' works to be produced, and as a result, a planned sequel based on The Cat in the Hat Comes Back was scrapped.\n", "wiki_page_id": 4803480, "imdb_id": "tt0312528"}
