{"text": "\n\nMan Bites Dog (French: C'est arriv\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de chez vous, literally \"It has Happened near your Home\") is a 1992 Belgian black comedy crime mockumentary written, produced and directed by R\u00e9my Belvaux, Andr\u00e9 Bonzel and Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde, who are also the film's co-editor, cinematographer and lead actor respectively.\nThe film follows a crew of filmmakers following a serial killer, recording his horrific crimes for a documentary they are producing. At first dispassionate observers, they find themselves caught up in the increasingly chaotic and nihilistic violence. The film received the Andr\u00e9 Cavens Award for Best Film by the Belgian Film Critics Association (UCC). Since its release, the picture has become a cult film, and received a rare NC-17 rating for its release in the U.S.", "wiki_page_id": 73585, "imdb_id": "tt0103905"}
