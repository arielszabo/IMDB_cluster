{"text": "Yojimbo (\u7528\u5fc3\u68d2, Y\u014djinb\u014d) is a 1961 samurai film directed by Akira Kurosawa. It tells the story of a r\u014dnin, portrayed by Toshiro Mifune, who arrives in a small town where competing crime lords vie for supremacy. The two bosses each try to hire the newcomer as a bodyguard.\nBased on the success of Yojimbo, Kurosawa's next film, Sanjuro (1962), was altered to incorporate the lead character of this film. In both films, the character wears a rather dilapidated dark kimono bearing the same family mon (likely the emblem of his former samurai clan, before he became a r\u014dnin).\n", "wiki_page_id": 312498, "imdb_id": "tt0055630"}
