{"text": "The Class (French: Entre les murs, lit.\u00a0'Between the walls') is a 2008 French drama film directed by Laurent Cantet, based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e9gaudeau. The novel is a semi-autobiographical account of B\u00e9gaudeau's experiences as a French language and literature teacher in a middle school in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, particularly illuminating his struggles with \"problem children\": Esmerelda (Esmeralda Ouertani), Khoumba (Rachel Regulier), and Souleymane (Franck Ke\u00efta). The film stars B\u00e9gaudeau himself in the role of the teacher.The film received the Palme d'Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, making it the first French film to do so since 1987, when Maurice Pialat won the award for  Under the Sun of Satan. The Class was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but lost to Departures.\n", "wiki_page_id": 17618782, "imdb_id": "tt1068646"}
