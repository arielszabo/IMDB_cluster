{"text": "\n\nEnough Said is a 2013 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. The film stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus, James Gandolfini, Catherine Keener, Toni Collette and Ben Falcone. Louis-Dreyfus plays Eva, a divorced masseuse who begins a relationship with Albert (Gandolfini), only to discover that he is the ex-husband of her client and friend Marianne (Keener).\nHolofcener wrote the script, which was partly inspired by her own life, after she was approached by two producers from Fox Searchlight Pictures who offered to produce her next project. It was filmed in Los Angeles on a budget of $8 million. Gandolfini died after the film was completed but before it was released; Holofcener dedicated the film to him.\nEnough Said premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and was released on September 18, 2013, ranking as the fifth best-reviewed wide release of the year, according to Rotten Tomatoes. The film was praised for Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini's performances, as well as Holofcener's screenplay and direction, and received several major award nominations, including for a Golden Globe for Louis-Dreyfus (her first nomination for a film role), a Screen Actors Guild Award, two Independent Spirit Awards and four Critics' Choice Movie Awards.\n", "wiki_page_id": 40069788, "imdb_id": "tt2390361"}
