It stars Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden, Deborah Kara Unger, Kim Coates, Tanya Allen, Alice Krige, and Jodelle Ferland.\nThe film follows Rose, who takes her adopted daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, for which Sharon cries while sleepwalking. Arriving at Silent Hill, Rose is involved in a car accident and awakens to find Sharon missing; while searching for her daughter, she fights a local cult while uncovering Sharon's connection to the town's past.\nDevelopment of Silent Hill began in the early 2000s. After attempting to gain the film rights to Silent Hill for five years, Gans sent a video interview to them explaining his plans for adapting Silent Hill and how important the games are to him. Konami awarded him the film rights as a result. Gans and Avary began working on the script in 2004. Avary used Centralia, Pennsylvania as an inspiration for the town. Filming began in February 2005 with an estimated $50 million budget and was shot on sound sets and on location in Canada (Brantford, Ontario and Hamilton, Ontario).\nSilent Hill was released on April 21, 2006, grossing nearly $100 million worldwide. Film critics praised the film's visuals, set designs, and atmosphere, but criticized the film for its dialogue, plot, and run-time. A sequel entitled Silent Hill: Revelation was released on October 26, 2012 to critical failure, but modest commercial success.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2465576, "imdb_id": "tt0384537"}
