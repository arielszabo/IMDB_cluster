{"text": "The Jewel of the Nile is a 1985 action-adventure romantic comedy and a sequel to the 1984 film Romancing the Stone, directed by Lewis Teague and produced by one of its stars,  Michael Douglas. The film reunites Douglas with Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito, all reprising their roles. Like Romancing the Stone, the opening scene takes place in one of Joan's novels. This time, instead of Jesse and Angelina in Joan's wild-west scenario, Joan and Jack are about to be married when pirates attack their ship. The Jewel of the Nile sends its characters off on a new adventure in a fictional African desert, in an effort to find the fabled \"Jewel of the Nile\".\n\nThe Jewel of the Nile is notable for its top 40 theme song performed by Billy Ocean, \"When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going\".", "wiki_page_id": 2871613, "imdb_id": "tt0089370"}
