The films catapulted Eastwood and Van Cleef into stardom.Film historian Richard Schickel, in his biography of Clint Eastwood, believed that this was the best film in the trilogy, arguing that it was \"more elegant and complex than A Fistful of Dollars and more tense and compressed than The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\" Director Alex Cox considered the church scene to be one of \"the most horrible deaths\" of any Western, describing Volont\u00e8's Indio as the \"most diabolical Western villain of all time.\"", "wiki_page_id": 442300, "imdb_id": "tt0059578"}
