{"text": "\n\nCorvette Captain Georg Ludwig Ritter von Trapp (4 April 1880 \u2013 30 May 1947), was an Austro-Hungarian Navy officer. His naval exploits during World War I earned him numerous decorations, including the prestigious Military Order of Maria Theresa. Under his command, the submarines SM\u00a0U-5 and SM\u00a0U-14 sank 13 Allied ships  totaling about 45,669\u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT).\nFollowing Austria-Hungary's collapse after the war, von Trapp returned to his family, but lost his first wife to scarlet fever in 1922. Five years later, von Trapp later remarried to his children's tutor, Maria Augusta Kutschera. Most of the family's wealth was wiped out during the Great Depression, after von Trapp transferred his savings from a bank in London into an Austrian bank. Maria later trained the children to perform at various events as a way of earning a livelihood. The family came under increasing persecution from the Nazis after the Anschluss, when von Trapp refused to serve in the German Navy due to his opposition to Nazi ideology. Fearing persecution, von Trapp fled with his family to Italy and later to the United States, where he set up a ranch and lived the remainder of his life there until his death in 1947. \nMaria later wrote of their time together in her memoir, The Story of the Trapp Family Singers. The story of the von Trapp family served as the inspiration for Rodgers and Hammerstein's Broadway stage musical, The Sound of Music in 1959.", "wiki_page_id": 62582, "imdb_id": "tt2932536"}
