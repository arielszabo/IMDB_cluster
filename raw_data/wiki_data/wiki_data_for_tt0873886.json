{"text": "Red State is a 2011 American independent action thriller film written and directed by Kevin Smith and starring John Goodman, Melissa Leo and Michael Parks.\nAfter months of saying that the distribution rights to the film would be auctioned off immediately after the premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, Smith controversially announced that he was instead going to self-distribute the picture under the SModcast Pictures banner with a traveling show in select cities.\nOn June 28, 2011, Smith announced a one-week run in Quentin Tarantino's New Beverly Cinema (making the film eligible for Academy Award consideration). The film was released via video on demand on September 1, 2011 through Lionsgate, in select theaters for a special one-night-only engagement on September 23, 2011 (via SModcast Pictures), and on home video October 18, 2011.", "wiki_page_id": 26911870, "imdb_id": "tt0873886"}
