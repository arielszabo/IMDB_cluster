{"text": "Bride of Chucky is a 1998 American horror comedy film, the fourth installment of the Child's Play franchise and sequel to 1991's Child's Play 3. The film is written by Don Mancini and directed by Ronny Yu, and stars Jennifer Tilly (who plays and voices the title character Tiffany) and Brad Dourif (who voices Chucky), as well as John Ritter, Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile.Unlike the first three Child's Play films, this film takes a markedly humorous turn and often into self-referential parody. It does not continue on with the concept of a child victim in possession of the doll, thus the absence of Child's Play in the title. From this entry and onward, Chucky became the official brand name of the film. Instead, the film focuses entirely on the doll characters as antiheroes. It was followed by Seed of Chucky in 2004.\nIt is the last film in the series to be released by Universal Pictures until Curse of Chucky.\n", "wiki_page_id": 30865068, "imdb_id": "tt0144120"}
