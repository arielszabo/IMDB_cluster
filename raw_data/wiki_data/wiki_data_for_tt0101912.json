{"text": "Frankie and Johnny is a 1991 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall and starring Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer in their first film together since Scarface (1983). H\u00e9ctor Elizondo, Nathan Lane and Kate Nelligan appeared in supporting roles. The original score was composed by Marvin Hamlisch.\nThe screenplay for Frankie and Johnny was adapted by Terrence McNally from his own off-Broadway play Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune (1987), which featured Kenneth Welsh and Kathy Bates. The most notable alteration in the film was the addition of several supporting characters and various locations; in the original play, only the two eponymous characters appeared onstage, and the entire drama took place in one apartment.The title is a reference to the traditional American popular song \"Frankie and Johnny\", first published in 1904, which tells the story of a woman who finds her man making love to another woman and shoots him dead.", "wiki_page_id": 1769515, "imdb_id": "tt0101912"}
