{"text": "\n\n\n\nIncredibles 2 is a 2018 American computer-animated film produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Written and directed by Brad Bird, it is the sequel to The Incredibles (2004) and the second installment of the franchise. The story follows the Parr family as they try to restore public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner (replacing Spencer Fox), Bob Odenkirk, Catherine Keener and Jonathan Banks (replacing Bud Luckey). Michael Giacchino returned to compose the score.\nFollowing the success of The Incredibles, Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\nIncredibles 2 premiered in Los Angeles on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018, in Disney Digital 3-D, Dolby Cinema and IMAX. It received largely positive reviews; critics praised its animation, voice acting, humor, action, and score, although some criticized the plot as derivative of the original. The film made $182.7\u00a0million in its opening weekend, setting the record for best debut for an animated film, and has grossed over $1.1\u00a0billion worldwide, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 2018, the second highest-grossing animated film and the 17th highest-grossing film of all-time.\n", "wiki_page_id": 39502474, "imdb_id": "tt3606756"}
