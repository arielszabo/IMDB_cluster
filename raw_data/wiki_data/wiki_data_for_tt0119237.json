{"text": "\n\nGummo is a 1997 American art film written and directed by Harmony Korine, starring Jacob Reynolds, Nick Sutton, Jacob Sewell, and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. The film is set in Xenia, Ohio, a small, poor Midwestern American town that had been previously struck by a devastating tornado. The loose narrative follows several main characters who find odd and destructive ways to pass time, interrupted by vignettes depicting other inhabitants of the town. \"Gummo\" is considered to be a cult film.\nKorine's directorial debut, the film was shot in Nashville, Tennessee on a budget of $1 million. Gummo was not given a large theatrical release and failed to generate large box office revenues. The film generated substantial press for its graphic content and stylized, loosely woven narrative.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1176717, "imdb_id": "tt0119237"}
