{"text": "\n\nAlien vs. Predator (also known as AVP and stylized as \u039bVP) is a 2004 science fiction action film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, and starring Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen and Ewen Bremner. \nIt is the first installment of the Alien vs. Predator franchise, adapting a crossover bringing together the eponymous creatures of the Alien and Predator series, a concept which originated in a 1989 comic book written by Randy Stradley and Chris Warner. Set in 2004, the film follows a group of archaeologists assembled by billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland for an expedition near the Antarctic to investigate a mysterious heat signal. Weyland hopes to claim the find for himself, and his group discovers a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station. Hieroglyphs and sculptures reveal that the pyramid is a hunting ground for young Predators who kill Aliens as a rite of passage. The humans are caught in the middle of a battle between the two species and attempt to prevent the Aliens from reaching the surface. \nAnderson, Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett wrote the story, and Anderson and Shane Salerno adapted the story into a screenplay. Their writing was influenced by Aztec mythology, the comic book series, and the writings of Erich von D\u00e4niken. \nAlien vs. Predator was released on August 13, 2004 in North America, and received negative reviews from critics. The film grossed over $172 million at the worldwide box office. A sequel, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, was released in December 2007.\n", "wiki_page_id": 901421, "imdb_id": "tt0370263"}
