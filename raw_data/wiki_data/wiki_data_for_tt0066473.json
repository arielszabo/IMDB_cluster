(Japanese: \u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30c8\u30e9) is a 1970 Japanese-American biographical war drama film that dramatizes the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The film was directed by Richard Fleischer, Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku, and stars an ensemble cast including Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, S\u014d Yamamura, E. G. Marshall, James Whitmore and Jason Robards.\nThe tora of the title is the two-syllable Japanese codeword used to indicate that complete surprise had been achieved. Japanese being a language with many homophones, it is a coincidence that tora also means \"tiger\" (\u864e).", "wiki_page_id": 58018, "imdb_id": "tt0066473"}
