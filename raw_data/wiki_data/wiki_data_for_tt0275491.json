{"text": "\n\nBad Education (Spanish: La mala educaci\u00f3n) is a 2004 Spanish drama film written and directed by Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Fele Mart\u00ednez, Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho and Llu\u00eds Homar, the film focuses on two reunited childhood friends and lovers caught up in a stylised murder mystery. Along with metafiction, sexual abuse by Catholic priests, transsexuality and drug use are also important themes and devices in the plot, which led the MPAA to give the film an NC-17 rating.\nThe film was released on 19 March 2004 in Spain and 10 September 2004 in Mexico. It was also screened at many international film festivals such as Cannes, New York, Moscow and Toronto before its US release on November 19, 2004. The film received critical acclaim, and was seen as a return to Almodovar's dark stage, placing it alongside films such as Matador (1986) and Law of Desire (1987).\n", "wiki_page_id": 1040571, "imdb_id": "tt0275491"}
