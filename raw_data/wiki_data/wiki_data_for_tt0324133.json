{"text": "\n\nSwimming Pool is a 2003 French-British erotic thriller film directed by Fran\u00e7ois Ozon and starring Charlotte Rampling and Ludivine Sagnier. The plot focuses on a British crime novelist, Sarah Morton, who travels to her publisher's upmarket summer house in Southern France to seek solitude in order to work on her next book. However, the arrival of Julie, who claims to be the publisher's daughter, induces complications and a subsequent crime.\nWhile the film's protagonist is British and both of the lead characters are bilingual, the majority of the story takes place in France \u2013 thus, the dialogue throughout the film is a mixture of French and English, which is appropriately subtitled.\nSwimming Pool premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 2003, and was released in France a few days later, with a U cinema rating, meaning it was deemed suitable for all ages. It was given a limited release in the United States that July, and was edited in order to avoid an NC-17 rating due to its sexual content and nudity. It was subsequently released in North America on DVD in an unrated cut.\nThe film ignited controversy with audiences because of its ambiguous nature and unclear conclusion which can be interpreted and argued in various ways \u2013 while in France many comparisons were made with Jacques Deray's 1969 film La Piscine (\"The Swimming Pool\"), starring Romy Schneider and Alain Delon.\n", "wiki_page_id": 950429, "imdb_id": "tt0324133"}
