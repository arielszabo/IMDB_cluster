{"text": "The Man in the Iron Mask is a 1998 American action drama film directed, produced, and written by Randall Wallace, and starring Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role as the title character and villain, Jeremy Irons as Aramis, John Malkovich as Athos, Gerard Depardieu as Porthos, and Gabriel Byrne as D'Artagnan. The  picture uses characters from Alexandre Dumas's D'Artagnan Romances and is very loosely adapted from some plot elements of The Vicomte de Bragelonne.\nThe film centers on the aging four musketeers, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, during the reign of King Louis XIV and attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot more closely related to the flamboyant 1929 version starring Douglas Fairbanks, The Iron Mask, and the 1939 version directed by James Whale, than to the original Dumas book.  Like the 1998 version, the two aforementioned adaptations were also released through United Artists.\n", "wiki_page_id": 5169996, "imdb_id": "tt0120744"}
