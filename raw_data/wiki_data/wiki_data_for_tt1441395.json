{"text": "\n\nUnder the Skin is a 2013  science fiction film directed and co-written by Jonathan Glazer, loosely based on Michel Faber's 2000 novel of the same name. It stars Scarlett Johansson as an otherworldly woman who preys on men in Scotland. The film premiered at Telluride Film Festival on 29 August 2013, and it was released in the UK on 14 March 2014, and in the United States on 4 April 2014.\nGlazer developed Under the Skin for over a decade; he and cowriter Walter Campbell pared it back from an elaborate, special effects-heavy concept to a sparse story focusing on an alien perspective of the human world. Most characters were played by non-actors, and many scenes were filmed with hidden cameras.\nWith a total worldwide gross of \u00a35.2 million, Under the Skin was a box office failure. Nevertheless, it received positive reviews, particularly for Johansson's performance, Glazer's direction, and Mica Levi's score. It received multiple awards and was named one of 2014's best films by several publications. It ranks 61st on the BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century list.\n", "wiki_page_id": 39502001, "imdb_id": "tt1441395"}
