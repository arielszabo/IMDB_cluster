{"text": "\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera is a 2004 British-American musical drama film based on Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical of the same name, which in turn is based on the French novel Le Fant\u00f4me de l'Op\u00e9ra by Gaston Leroux. Produced and co-written by Lloyd Webber and directed by Joel Schumacher, it stars Gerard Butler in the title role, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver and Jennifer Ellison.\nThe film was announced in 1989 but production did not start until 2002 due to Lloyd Webber's divorce and Schumacher's busy career. It was shot entirely at Pinewood Studios, with scenery created with miniatures and computer graphics. Rossum, Wilson and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had none and so had music lessons. The Phantom of the Opera grossed $154.6 million worldwide and received mixed to negative reviews from critics, but was very well received by audiences. Critics praised the visuals and acting (particularly Rossum's performance) but criticized the writing and directing.\n", "wiki_page_id": 308856, "imdb_id": "tt0293508"}
