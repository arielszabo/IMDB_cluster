{"text": "\n\nThe Wicker Man is a 2006 horror film written and directed by Neil LaBute and starring Nicolas Cage. The film primarily is a remake of the 1973 film The Wicker Man, but also draws from its source material, David Pinner's 1967 novel Ritual. The film concerns a policeman named Edward Malus who is informed by his ex-fianc\u00e9e Willow Woodward that her daughter Rowan has disappeared and asks for his assistance in her search. When he arrives at the island where Rowan was last seen he begins to suspect something sinister is afoot with the neo-pagans who reside on the island.\nThe film received hostile reviews from film critics at the time of its release; critics pointed to the film's unintentional comedy, weak acting, and poor screenwriting. The film was also a financial flop, grossing over $38 million against a $40 million production budget. Since its original release, it has developed a cult following as an entertaining unintentional comedy, particularly due to Cage's over-the-top performance.\nCage dedicated the film to his friend Johnny Ramone, the guitarist of the band The Ramones, who had died in 2004.\n", "wiki_page_id": 5515243, "imdb_id": "tt0450345"}
