{"text": "\n\nThe Dead Pool is a 1988 American action film directed by Buddy Van Horn, written by Steve Sharon, and starring Clint Eastwood as Inspector \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan. It is the fifth and final film in the Dirty Harry film series, set in San Francisco, California.\nThe story concerns the manipulation of a dead pool game by a serial killer, whose efforts are confronted by the hardened detective Callahan. It co-stars Liam Neeson and Patricia Clarkson, with Jim Carrey in his first action dramatic role.\nIt is the only film in the series to not feature Albert Popwell, an actor who had played a different character in each of the previous four films.\nAt 91 minutes, it is the shortest of the five Dirty Harry film series. Like those films, The Dead Pool is notable for coining catchphrases uttered by Clint Eastwood's gun-wielding character, one of which is: \"Opinions are like assholes; everybody has one\".\n", "wiki_page_id": 1179278, "imdb_id": "tt0094963"}
