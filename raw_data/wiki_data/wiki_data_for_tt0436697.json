{"text": "\n\nThe Queen is a 2006 British fictional drama film depicting the British Royal Family's response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, on 31 August 1997. The film was directed by Stephen Frears, written by Peter Morgan, and starred Helen Mirren in the title role of Queen Elizabeth II.Initially, the Queen and Prince Philip regard Diana's death as a private affair and thus not to be treated as an official royal death. This is in contrast with the views of Tony Blair and Diana's ex-husband, Prince Charles, who favour the general public's desire for an official expression of grief. Matters are further complicated by the media, royal protocol regarding Diana's official status, and wider issues about Republicanism.\nThe film's release coincided with a revival of favourable public sentiment in respect to the monarchy and a downturn in fortunes for Blair. Michael Sheen reprised his role as Tony Blair from The Deal, and he did so again in The Special Relationship. The Queen also garnered general critical and popular acclaim for Mirren in the title role, which earned her numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress. Mirren was also praised by the Queen herself and was invited to dinner at Buckingham Palace (though she could not attend due to filming commitments in Hollywood).", "wiki_page_id": 6542034, "imdb_id": "tt0436697"}
