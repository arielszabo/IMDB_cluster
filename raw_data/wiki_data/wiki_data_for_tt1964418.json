Bird co-wrote the film's screenplay with Damon Lindelof, from an original story treatment by Bird, Lindelof and Jeff Jensen. The film stars George Clooney, Hugh Laurie, Britt Robertson, Raffey Cassidy, Tim McGraw, Kathryn Hahn, and Keegan-Michael Key. In the film, a disillusioned genius inventor (Clooney) and a teenage science enthusiast (Robertson) embark to an ambiguous alternate dimension known as \"Tomorrowland\", where their actions directly affect their own world.\nWalt Disney Pictures originally announced the film in June 2011 under the working title 1952, and later retitled it to Tomorrowland, after the futuristic themed land found at Disney theme parks. In drafting their story, Bird and Lindelof took inspiration from the progressive cultural movements of the Space Age, as well as Walt Disney's optimistic philosophy of the future, notably his conceptual vision for the planned community known as EPCOT. Principal photography began in August 2013, with scenes shot at multiple locales in five countries.Tomorrowland was released in conventional and IMAX formats on May 22, 2015, and was the first theatrical film to be released in Dolby Vision and Dolby Cinema. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews from critics; earning praise for its original premise, acting, musical score, action, visuals, and themes, but criticism in regards to the screenplay's uneven writing and tone. The film grossed $209 million worldwide against a total production and marketing cost of $330 million, losing Disney $120\u2013140 million.\n", "wiki_page_id": 38357478, "imdb_id": "tt1964418"}
