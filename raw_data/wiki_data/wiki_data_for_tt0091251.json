The film stars Aleksei Kravchenko and Olga Mironova. Come and See appears on many lists of films considered the best, and has been ranked by many as one of the greatest war films of all time.  \nThe film focuses upon the Nazi German occupation of the Byelorussian SSR, and primarily upon the events witnessed by a young Belarusian partisan teenager named Flyora, who\u2014against his parents' wishes\u2014joins the Belarusian resistance movement, and thereafter depicts the Nazi atrocities and human suffering inflicted upon the populace.\nCome and See had to wait eight years for approval from Soviet authorities before the film was finally produced to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War II, and was a large box-office hit, with 28,900,000 admissions in the Soviet Union alone. The film was selected as the Soviet entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 58th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\n", "wiki_page_id": 4492505, "imdb_id": "tt0091251"}
