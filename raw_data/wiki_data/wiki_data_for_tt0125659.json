{"text": "Open Your Eyes (Spanish: Abre los ojos) is a 1997 Spanish film co-written, co-scored and directed by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar and co-written by Mateo Gil. It stars Eduardo Noriega, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Fele Mart\u00ednez and Najwa Nimri. In 2002, Open Your Eyes was ranked no. 84 in the Top 100 Sci-Fi List by the Online Film Critics Society. The movie's intersecting planes of dream and reality have prompted some critics to suggest comparisons to Calder\u00f3n's play Life Is a Dream (Spanish: La vida es sue\u00f1o, 1635).An American remake entitled Vanilla Sky, directed by Cameron Crowe, was released in 2001, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz reprising her role.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 679636, "imdb_id": "tt0125659"}
