{"text": "Miracle on 34th Street is a 1994 American Christmas fantasy film written and produced by John Hughes, and directed by Les Mayfield (the two would reunite for 1997's Flubber). It stars Richard Attenborough, Mara Wilson, Elizabeth Perkins, and Dylan McDermott, and is the fourth remake (and the second theatrical version) of the original 1947 film. Like the original, this film was released by 20th Century Fox.\nThe New York City based Macy's department store declined any involvement with this remake, so the fictitious \"Cole's\" was used as its replacement. Gimbels had gone out of business in 1987; hence it was replaced by the fictional \"Shopper's Express\".\n", "wiki_page_id": 20700559, "imdb_id": "tt0110527"}
