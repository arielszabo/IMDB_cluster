{"text": "Kod Ad\u0131: K.O.Z. is a 2015 Turkish film, directed by Celal \u00c7imen, starring Cem Kurto\u011flu, Tolga Karel, Hakan Ural and Haz\u0131m K\u00f6rm\u00fck\u00e7\u00fc. It tells the story of the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey and other recent political events, from the viewpoint that they are conspiracies against the Erdo\u011fan government by the \"Parallel state\". It features Erdo\u011fan as the protagonist and the G\u00fclen movement and Fethullah G\u00fclen as the antagonist.\nWith \"confused and primitive\" editing, acting described as robotic, and an \"unfathomable\" screenplay, one reviewer described it as being not even worthy of belonging to the genre of film propaganda like Triumph of the Will.Shortly after its February 2015 release, the movie ranked at the bottom of IMDb's Bottom 100 list, with an average score of 1.0 (lowest possible) from more than 5,000 users. Its rating subsequently slightly increased, though it remains at #1 of IMDb's list as of June 2018 with a current rating of 1.6. For its cinematic release in Turkey, despite being of minority interest, the film was distributed to 850 cinemas, resulting in several mainstream movies missing their release dates. Today's Zaman speculated that this was because cinema owners considered that the Turkish authorities expected its screening to be mandatory. Because of the lack of interest from movie-goers, several cinemas ended up showing it for free.", "wiki_page_id": 45512373, "imdb_id": "tt4458206"}
