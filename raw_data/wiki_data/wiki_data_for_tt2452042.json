{"text": "The Peanuts Movie (known in some countries as Snoopy and Charlie Brown: The Peanuts Movie) is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy film based on Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts, produced by Blue Sky Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the fifth full-length Peanuts film, and the first feature film in 35 years. The film is directed by Steve Martino from a screenplay by Craig and Bryan Schulz (Schulz's son and grandson, respectively), and Cornelius Uliano, and stars the voices of Noah Schnapp as Charlie Brown and, via archival recordings, Bill Melendez as Snoopy and Woodstock. The film sees Charlie Brown trying to improve his odds with the Little Red-Haired Girl, while Snoopy writes a book about the World War I Flying Ace as he imagines himself as a legend trying to save his love interest and fellow pilot Fifi from the Red Baron and his army.\nThe Peanuts Movie was released on November 6, 2015, commemorating the 65th anniversary of the original comic strip and the 50th anniversary of the TV special A Charlie Brown Christmas. It grossed $246 million worldwide against a $99 million budget.  The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes calls it \"sweetly nostalgic\" though unambitious.  It received nominations for the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature, the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature, and was the first Blue Sky Studios film to be nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film.\n", "wiki_page_id": 39367067, "imdb_id": "tt2452042"}
