{"text": "Rambo (also known as Rambo IV and John Rambo) is a 2008 American action film directed, and co-written by Sylvester Stallone. It is the fourth installment in the Rambo franchise. The film stars Stallone, Julie Benz, Paul Schulze, Matthew Marsden, Graham McTavish, Rey Gallegos, Tim Kang, Jake La Botz, Maung Maung Khin, and Ken Howard. The film is dedicated to Richard Crenna, who played Colonel Sam Trautman in the previous films, and who died of heart failure in 2003.\nThe rights to the Rambo series were sold to Miramax in 1997 after Carolco Pictures went bankrupt. Miramax intended to produce a fourth film but Stallone was unmotivated to reprise the role. The rights were then sold to Nu Image and Millennium Films in 2005, who green-lit the film before the release of Rocky Balboa. Filming began in January 2007 in Thailand, Mexico, and the United States and ended in May 2007.\nRambo was released on January 25, 2008 to mixed reviews. It grossed $42 million domestically and $113.2 million worldwide against a budget of $50 million. Plans for a fifth film were announced on and off again since 2008, with Stallone confirming in May 2018 a Fall 2019 release date for Rambo V.", "wiki_page_id": 18850952, "imdb_id": "tt0462499"}
