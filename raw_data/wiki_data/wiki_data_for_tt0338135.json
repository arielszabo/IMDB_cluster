{"text": "\n\nThe Barbarian Invasions (French: Les Invasions barbares) is a 2003 Canadian-French sex comedy-drama film written and directed by Denys Arcand and starring R\u00e9my Girard, St\u00e9phane Rousseau and Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze. The film is a sequel to Arcand's 1986 film The Decline of the American Empire, continuing the story of the character R\u00e9my, a womanizing history professor now terminally ill with cancer.\nThe sequel was a result of Arcand's longtime desire to make a film about a character close to death, also incorporating a response to the September 11 attacks of 2001. It was produced by companies from both Canada and France, and shot mainly in Montreal, also employing a former hospital and property near Lake Memphremagog.\nThe film received a positive response from critics and became one of Arcand's biggest financial successes. It was the first Canadian film to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, at the 76th Academy Awards in 2004. It won awards at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, six Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, and three C\u00e9sar Awards, including Best Film. The Barbarian Invasions was followed by the thematically related Days of Darkness in 2007 and The Fall of the American Empire in 2018.\n", "wiki_page_id": 496640, "imdb_id": "tt0338135"}
