{"text": "\n\nNutty Professor II: The Klumps is a 2000 American science-fiction romantic-comedy film directed by Peter Segal. It is a sequel to the 1996 film The Nutty Professor and stars Eddie Murphy. As in the original film, Murphy plays not only the clumsy but brilliant scientist, Sherman Klump, but also (wearing different, but equally elaborate makeup) most of Sherman's family.\nIn contrast to the previous film, subplots which are centered on his parents (with his brother and grandmother, providing comic relief) occupy a substantial part of the film. Like the first film, the sequel's theme song is \"Macho Man\" by The Village People, which this time is played during the end credits.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1917459, "imdb_id": "tt0144528"}
