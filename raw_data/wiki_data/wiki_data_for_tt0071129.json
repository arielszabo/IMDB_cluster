{"text": "\n\nAmarcord is a 1973 Italian comedy-drama film directed by Federico Fellini, a semi-autobiographical tale about Titta, an adolescent boy growing up among an eccentric cast of characters in the village of Borgo San Giuliano (situated near the ancient walls of Rimini) in 1930s Fascist Italy. The film's title (pronounced\u00a0[amar\u02c8k\u0254rd]) is a univerbation of the Romagnolo phrase \"a m'arcord\" (\"I remember\"). The title then became a neologism of the Italian language, with the meaning of 'nostalgic revocation'.\nTitta's sentimental education is emblematic of Italy's \"lapse of conscience.\" Fellini skewers Mussolini's ludicrous posturings and those of a Catholic Church that \"imprisoned Italians in a perpetual adolescence\" by mocking himself and his fellow villagers in comic scenes that underline their incapacity to adopt genuine moral responsibility or outgrow foolish sexual fantasies.\nThe film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and was nominated for two more Oscars: Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.\n", "wiki_page_id": 239086, "imdb_id": "tt0071129"}
