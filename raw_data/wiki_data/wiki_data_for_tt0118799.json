{"text": "\n\nLife Is Beautiful (Italian: La vita \u00e8 bella [la \u02c8vi\u02d0ta \u02cc\u025b b\u02c8b\u025blla]) is a 1997 Italian comedy-drama film directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, who co-wrote the film with Vincenzo Cerami. Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, who employs his fertile imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a Nazi concentration camp. The film was partially inspired by the book In the End, I Beat Hitler by Rubino Romeo Salmon\u00ec and by Benigni's father, who spent two years in a German labour camp during World War II.\nThe film was a critical and financial success, despite criticisms of using the subject matter for comedic purposes. It won the Grand Prix at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, nine David di Donatello Awards, including Best Film, in Italy, and three Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Benigni.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 142463, "imdb_id": "tt0118799"}
