{"text": "\n\nLolita is a 1997 American-French drama film directed by Adrian Lyne and written by Stephen Schiff. It is the second screen adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel of the same name and stars Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert and Dominique Swain as Dolores \"Lolita\" Haze, with supporting roles by Melanie Griffith as Charlotte Haze, and Frank Langella as Clare Quilty. The film is about a middle-aged male professor, Humbert, who rents a room in the house of the widow Charlotte Haze because he is sexually attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \"Lo\" or \"Lolita\".\nThe film had difficulty finding an American distributor and premiered in Europe before being released in America. The film was eventually picked up in the United States by Showtime, a cable network, before finally being released theatrically by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. The performances by Irons and Swain impressed audiences, but, although praised by some critics for its faithfulness to Nabokov's narrative, the film received a mixed critical reception in the United States. Lolita was met with much controversy in Australia, where it was not given a theatrical release until April 1999.", "wiki_page_id": 1988806, "imdb_id": "tt0119558"}
