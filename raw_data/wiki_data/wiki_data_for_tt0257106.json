{"text": "\n\nScary Movie 2 is a 2001 American horror comedy film and the second film in the Scary Movie franchise. The film stars Anna Faris,  Regina Hall, Shawn Wayans, and Marlon Wayans (all reprising their roles from the first film, despite their characters having been killed off), as well as Tim Curry, Tori Spelling, Chris Elliott, Chris Masterson, Kathleen Robertson, David Cross, and James Woods.\nWhere the original film was mainly based on the slasher films of the '90s, Scary Movie 2 parodies an array of supernatural and haunted house films from various decades, including The Haunting (1999), The Exorcist (1973), The Amityville Horror (1979), Poltergeist (1982), The Legend of Hell House (1973), House on Haunted Hill (both the 1959 and 1999 versions), and The Changeling (1980). It also spoofs some contemporary films, such as Hannibal (2001), and Hollow Man (2000).\nThe film is the last in the series to feature the involvement of stars Marlon and Shawn Wayans, and director Keenen Ivory Wayans. However, the Wayans would eventually go on to produce a similar horror-themed parody, A Haunted House, and its sequel, both starring Marlon Wayans.\nDespite generally negative reviews from critics, Scary Movie 2 was a box office success, grossing $141.2 million worldwide from a $45 million budget.", "wiki_page_id": 532618, "imdb_id": "tt0257106"}
