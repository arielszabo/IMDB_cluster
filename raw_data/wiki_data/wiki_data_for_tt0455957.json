The film stars Javier Bardem, Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, and was filmed on location in Spain during late 2005. The film was written, produced, and performed in English although it is a Spanish production.\nAlthough the historical setting of the film is authentic, the story about Goya trying to defend a model is fictional, as are the characters Brother Lorenzo and the Bilbat\u00faa family.\n", "wiki_page_id": 3196327, "imdb_id": "tt0455957"}
