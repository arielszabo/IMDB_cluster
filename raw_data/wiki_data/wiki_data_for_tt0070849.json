{"text": "\n\nLast Tango in Paris (Italian: Ultimo tango a Parigi) is a 1972 Italian-French erotic drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci which portrays a recently widowed American who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young Parisian woman. It stars Marlon Brando, Maria Schneider, and Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud.\nThe film's raw portrayal of sexual violence and emotional turmoil led to international controversy and drew various levels of government censorship in different venues. Upon release in the United States, the most graphic scene was cut and the MPAA gave the film an X rating. After revisions were made to the MPAA ratings code, in 1997 the film was re-classified NC-17 for \"some explicit sexual content\". Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released a censored R-rated cut in 1981.\n", "wiki_page_id": 163456, "imdb_id": "tt0070849"}
