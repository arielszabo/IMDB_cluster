{"text": "\n\nMighty Aphrodite is a 1995 American romantic comedy film written, directed by, and co-starring Woody Allen, alongside Mira Sorvino, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Rapaport, and F. Murray Abraham. The screenplay was inspired by the story of Pygmalion and is about Lenny Weinrib's (Allen) search for his genius adopted son's biological mother, ultimately finding that she is a dim-witted prostitute named Linda Ash (Sorvino).\nWhile critical reception of Mighty Aphrodite overall was mildly positive, Sorvino was widely praised for her performance, winning the 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, as well as a Golden Globe Award, New York Film Critics Circle Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, National Board of Review Award, and a Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1330432, "imdb_id": "tt0113819"}
