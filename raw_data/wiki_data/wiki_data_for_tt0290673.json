{"text": "\n\nIrr\u00e9versible (French pronunciation:\u00a0\u200b[i\u0281ev\u025b\u0281sibl]) is a 2002 French psychological thriller drama film, written and directed by Gaspar No\u00e9 and starring Monica Bellucci, Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel. The film employs a reverse chronology and follows two men through the streets of Paris as they seek to avenge a brutally raped girlfriend. The film's soundtrack was composed by Thomas Bangalter, one half of the electronic music duo Daft Punk.\nAmerican film critic Roger Ebert called it \"a movie so violent and cruel that most people will find it unwatchable\". Irr\u00e9versible competed at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and won the Stockholm International Film Festival's award for best film.\nIrr\u00e9versible has been associated with a series of films defined as the cin\u00e9ma du corps (\"cinema of the body\"), which according to Palmer share affinities with certain avant-garde productions: an attenuated use of narrative, assaulting and often illegible cinematography, confrontational subject material, and a pervasive sense of social nihilism or despair. Irr\u00e9versible has also been associated with the New French Extremity movement.\nThe film was particularly controversial upon its release for its graphic portrayal of violence, specifically the scene where a man is savagely bludgeoned to death with a fire extinguisher and its 10-minute long take rape of Alex (Monica Bellucci), who is then brutally beaten into a coma. It had accusations of apparent homophobia as well.\n", "wiki_page_id": 299490, "imdb_id": "tt0290673"}
