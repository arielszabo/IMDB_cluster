It is the first theatrical release in the Pok\u00e9mon franchise.\nIt was first released in Japan on July 18, 1998. On July 8, 1999, a Complete Version (\u5b8c\u5168\u7248 kanzenban) of the film was aired in Japanese television. In addition to an added prologue, the updated version included new animation and CGI graphics. The English-language adaptation, produced by Nintendo and 4Kids Entertainment and licensed by Warner Bros., was released in North America on November 10, 1999.\nThe film primarily consists of three segments: Pikachu's Vacation, a 21-minute feature focusing on the series mascot Pikachu; Origin of Mewtwo, the 10-minute  prologue added to the Complete Version of the film; and Mewtwo Strikes Back, the main 75-minute film feature. Overseas, the prologue can only be seen as a bonus short in DVD versions of Pok\u00e9mon: Mewtwo Returns.\nAlthough Pok\u00e9mon was extremely popular when the film was released, the English-language version received negative reviews from film critics.
