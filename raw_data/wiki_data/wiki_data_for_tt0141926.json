{"text": "\n\nU-571 is a 2000 French-American war film about a World War II German submarine boarded by American submariners to capture her Enigma cipher machine.\nAlthough the film was financially successful and reasonably well received by critics, the plot attracted substantial criticism as it was British sailors from HMS\u00a0Bulldog in May 1941 who captured an Enigma machine from U-110 in the North Atlantic, months before the United States entered the war. The anger over these inaccuracies reached the British Parliament, where Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed that the film was an \"affront\" to British sailors. The film was also criticized for portraying German U-boat crews in a negative light by showing them gunning down Allied survivors instead of giving them assistance or taking them aboard as prisoners.\n", "wiki_page_id": 32260, "imdb_id": "tt0141926"}
