{"text": "\n\nJay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a 2001 American comedy film written and directed by Kevin Smith, the fifth to be set in his View Askewniverse, a growing collection of characters and settings that developed out of his cult favorite Clerks. It focuses on the two eponymous characters, played respectively by Jason Mewes and Smith. The film features a large number of cameo appearances by famous actors and directors, and its title and logo for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back are direct references to The Empire Strikes Back.\nOriginally intended to be the last film set in the Askewniverse, or to feature Jay and Silent Bob, Strike Back features many characters from the previous Askew films, some in dual roles and reprising roles from the previous entries. The film was a minor commercial success, grossing $33.8 million worldwide from a $22 million budget, and received mixed reviews from critics.\nFive years later and following the commercial failure of Jersey Girl, Smith reconsidered and decided to continue the series with Clerks II, resurrecting Jay and Silent Bob in supporting roles. Smith announced in February 2017 that he was writing a sequel called Jay and Silent Bob Reboot and hoped to start filming in November 2018 for a tentative 2019 release.", "wiki_page_id": 101523, "imdb_id": "tt0261392"}
