{"text": "Friday the 13th Part III (also known as Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D) is a 1982 American slasher film directed by Steve Miner and produced by Frank Mancuso Jr.. It is the third installment in the Friday the 13th film series, and stars Dana Kimmell, Richard Brooker, Paul Kratka, Larry Zerner, and Tracie Savage. Set after the events of Friday the 13th Part 2, the plot concerns a teenage girl and her friends on vacation at a house on Crystal Lake, where a wounded Jason Voorhees has taken refuge. The film marks the debut of antagonist Jason Voorhees wearing his signature hockey mask, which has become a trademark of both the character and franchise, as well an icon in American cinema and horror films in general. \nOriginally, the story was supposed to focus on Ginny Field, who checked herself into a mental institution after her traumatic battle with Jason Voorhees in the previous film. The film would have been similar to Halloween II, with Jason tracking down Ginny in the mental hospital, but the concept was abandoned when Amy Steel declined to reprise her role.Friday the 13th Part III was originally released in 3D amongst other horror films such as Jaws 3-D and Amityville 3-D, and is the only film in the series to be released in 3-D. The film was intended to end the series as a trilogy, however the film did not include a moniker in its title to indicate it as such. The film was theatrically released on August 13, 1982, grossing over $36.6 million at the US box office on a budget of $2.3 million despite negative reviews. The film was the first to remove E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial from the number-one box office spot and became the second highest-grossing horror film of 1982, behind Poltergeist. It has the third most attendance of any film in the Friday the 13th series, with approximately 11,762,400 tickets sold during its initial run.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2317340, "imdb_id": "tt0083972"}
