{"text": "\n\nMommy is a 2014 Canadian drama film directed by Xavier Dolan and starring Anne Dorval, Antoine-Olivier Pilon, and Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment. The story concerns a mother with a sometimes-violent teenage son, struggling to control his behaviour in a hypothetical future in which parents have the legal option to commit troubled youth to public hospitals.\nThe story focuses on mother\u2013son relationships, a reoccurring theme in Dolan's work, and also marks his fourth collaboration with Dorval and his third with Cl\u00e9ment. Inspiration for this particular story was drawn from Dolan's discovery of Pilon and the music of Ludovico Einaudi. It was shot in Quebec in an unconventional aspect ratio.\nThe film debuted at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize. It subsequently became a critical and financial success, grossing over $13 million worldwide. Mommy went on to win numerous other awards, among them nine Canadian Screen Awards, including Best Motion Picture.\n", "wiki_page_id": 42517411, "imdb_id": "tt3612616"}
