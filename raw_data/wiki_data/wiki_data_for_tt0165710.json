Comparable to Rock 'n' Roll High School, Dazed and Confused, The St\u00f6ned Age, and I Wanna Hold Your Hand, it tells a coming-of-age story through a filter of 1970s music and culture in the United States. It ultimately took its title from the Kiss song of the same name.\nThe film was shot at Cedarbrae Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Toronto and other Ontario locations including Copps Coliseum in Hamilton.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1562557, "imdb_id": "tt0165710"}
