The original score composed by Jerry Goldsmith won the BMI Film Music Award.\nWith a budget of $50\u201365 million, Total Recall was one of the most expensive films made at the time of its release, although estimates of its production budget vary and whether it ever actually held the record is not certain.\n", "wiki_page_id": 55325, "imdb_id": "tt0100802"}
