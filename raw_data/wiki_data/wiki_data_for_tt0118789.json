{"text": "Buffalo '66 is a 1998 comedy-drama film that is writer-director Vincent Gallo's full-length motion picture debut. Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci star in the lead roles and the supporting cast includes Mickey Rourke, Rosanna Arquette, Ben Gazzara, and Anjelica Huston. Gallo also composed and performed much of the music for the film.\nThe film received critical acclaim and Empire listed it as the 36th-greatest independent film ever made. It was filmed in and around Gallo's native Buffalo, New York in winter. The film uses British progressive rock music in its soundtrack, notably King Crimson and Yes.\nThe title refers to the Buffalo Bills football team, with the number referring to the statement, \"They haven't won a championship since 1966.\"  This is critical to the plot which focuses on the Super Bowl in which the Bills, in the early 1990s, came very close to winning, but the game was blown with a missed field goal.\n", "wiki_page_id": 217835, "imdb_id": "tt0118789"}
