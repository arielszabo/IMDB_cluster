{"text": "\n\nAlexander is a 2004 epic historical drama film based on the life of the Macedonian general and king Alexander the Great. It was directed by Oliver Stone, with Colin Farrell in the title role. The film was an original screenplay based in part on the book Alexander the Great, written in the 1970s by the University of Oxford historian Robin Lane Fox. After release, while it performed well in Europe, the American critical reaction was negative. It grossed over $167 million worldwide against a $155 million budget.\nFour versions of the film exist, the initial theatrical cut and three home video director's cuts: the \"Director's Cut\" in 2005, the \"Final Cut\" in 2007 and the \"Ultimate Cut\" in 2013. The two earlier DVD versions of Alexander (\"director's cut\" version and the theatrical version) sold over 3.5 million copies in the United States.  Oliver Stone's third version, Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut (2007), sold nearly a million copies as of 2012.", "wiki_page_id": 1138675, "imdb_id": "tt0346491"}
