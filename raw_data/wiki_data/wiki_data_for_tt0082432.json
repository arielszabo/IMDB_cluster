{"text": "\n\nGallipoli is a 1981 Australian war drama film directed by Peter Weir and produced by Patricia Lovell and Robert Stigwood, starring Mel Gibson and Mark Lee, about several rural Western Australian young men who enlist in the Australian Army during the First World War. They are sent to the peninsula of Gallipoli in the Ottoman Empire (in modern-day Turkey), where they take part in the Gallipoli Campaign.  During the course of the movie, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the purpose of war.  The climax of the movie occurs on the Anzac battlefield at Gallipoli and depicts the futile attack at the Battle of the Nek on 7 August 1915. It does, however, modify events for dramatic purposes and contains a number of significant historical inaccuracies.\nGallipoli provides a faithful portrayal of life in Australia in the 1910s\u2014reminiscent of Weir's 1975 film Picnic at Hanging Rock set in 1900\u2014and captures the ideals and character of the Australians who joined up to fight, as well as the conditions they endured on the battlefield, although its portrayal of British forces has been crticised as inaccurate. It followed the Australian New Wave war film Breaker Morant (1980) and preceded the 5-part TV series ANZACs (1985), and The Lighthorsemen (1987). Recurring themes of these films include the Australian identity, such as mateship and larrikinism, the loss of innocence in war, and the continued coming of age of the Australian nation and its soldiers (later called the ANZAC spirit).\n", "wiki_page_id": 354122, "imdb_id": "tt0082432"}
