{"text": "The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) is a 2017 American comedy-drama film directed and written by Noah Baumbach. The film stars Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Elizabeth Marvel and Emma Thompson, and follows a group of dysfunctional adult siblings trying to live in the shadow of their father.\nThe Meyerowitz Stories was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section and also won the Palm Dog award at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised Baumbach's script and direction as well as the performances, with Sandler especially singled out for praise. It was released in select theaters and on streaming by Netflix on October 13, 2017.\nThe film was the second Netflix film competing at Cannes \u2013 along with Okja \u2013 which caused a clash with the jury president Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who sided with the opinion that Cannes Film Festival films should be made for big screens, not online streaming. In 2017, the Cannes Film Festival announced a new rule, which requires a film competing at Cannes to \"commit itself to being distributed in French movie theaters\". A French law mandates that films can't be shown on streaming services for 36 months after their theatrical release, effectively blocking Netflix films from future festivals.", "wiki_page_id": 49746122, "imdb_id": "tt5536736"}
