{"text": " Tales from Earthsea (Japanese: \u30b2\u30c9\u6226\u8a18, Hepburn: Gedo Senki, literally Ged's War Chronicles) is a 2006 Japanese animated fantasy film directed by Gor\u014d Miyazaki, animated by Studio Ghibli for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Mitsubishi and Toho, and distributed by the latter company. The film is based on a combination of plot and character elements from the first four books of Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series (A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore, and Tehanu), as well as the manga The Journey of Shuna by Hayao Miyazaki. The film's title is named from the collection of short stories, Tales from Earthsea, made in 2001. The plot was \"entirely different\" according to the author Ursula K. Le Guin, who told director Gor\u014d Miyazaki, \"It is not my book. It is your movie. It is a good movie\", although she later expressed her disappointment with the end result. A film comic adaptation of the film has been published in Japan.", "wiki_page_id": 3433026, "imdb_id": "tt0495596"}
