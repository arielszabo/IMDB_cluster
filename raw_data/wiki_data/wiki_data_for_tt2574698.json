{"text": "\n\nGunday (English: Outlaws) is a 2014 Indian action thriller film written and directed by Ali Abbas Zafar and produced by Aditya Chopra. The film features Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Irrfan Khan in the lead roles. Set in 1971\u20131988 Calcutta, Gunday is a story about two best friends and outlaws, who fall in love with a cabaret dancer, which causes rivalry and misunderstandings between them.\nZafar conceived the film as an amalgam of stories he had heard from his father as a child about the effects of war-caused immigration and the Mafia Raj's illegal marketing of coal. He wrote the film as a tale of the consequences of the struggle of two outlaws against the system, using his father's stories as a backdrop for the characters. Principal photography began in Mumbai in December 2012 before moving to Kolkata, where extensive filming was done. The soundtrack was produced by Sohail Sen and the lyrics were penned by Irshad Kamil. It was the last Yash Raj Film narrated to Yash Chopra.\nGunday was released on 14 February 2014, receiving positive reviews and commercial success, with a box-office gross of \u20b91.2 billion making it the 10th highest-grossing Bollywood release of 2014. The film won the Best Action at the 60th Filmfare Awards and was nominated for Best Choreography for the song \"Tune Maari Entriyaan\".\nDespite positive reception from critics, Gunday became a victim of vote brigading on the Internet Movie Database and it was one of the website's lowest-rated films. This was a result of a social-media campaign by Bangladeshis, who urged their fellow countrymen to \"bury the film\" because of a historical inaccuracy in its opening narration.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 38494633, "imdb_id": "tt2574698"}
