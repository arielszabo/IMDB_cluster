As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.\nThe Game was well received by critics like Roger Ebert and major periodicals like The New York Times, but had middling box-office returns compared to the success of Fincher's previous film, Seven.\n", "wiki_page_id": 3911312, "imdb_id": "tt0119174"}
