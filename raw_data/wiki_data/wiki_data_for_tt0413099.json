{"text": "\n\nEvan Almighty is a 2007 American fantasy disaster comedy film and the stand-alone sequel and spin-off of Bruce Almighty (2003). The film was directed by Tom Shadyac, written by  Steve Oedekerk, based on the characters created by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe from the original film, and starring Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham and John Goodman.\nProduction of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the most expensive comedy film ever at the time; it was later overtaken by Men in Black 3. In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.\nThe film grossed less than its budget of $175 million worldwide, and received generally negative reviews. Evan Almighty was also notable for allegations that the many animals used in the film were treated poorly, but Universal Pictures stressed that the animals' conditions were acceptable.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2576917, "imdb_id": "tt0413099"}
