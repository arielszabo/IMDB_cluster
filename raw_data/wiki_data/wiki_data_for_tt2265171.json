In The Raid, an elite squad is tasked to infiltrate a high-rise building\u00a0\u2013 run by a ruthless drug lord\u00a0\u2013 located in the slums of Jakarta; among them is Rama (played by Uwais), a rookie member of the team.\nAfter its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), The Raid received positive reviews from critics. The name of the film was changed to The Raid: Redemption in the United States as distributor Sony Pictures Classics could not secure the rights to the title; it also allowed Evans to plan out future titles in the series. The US release of the film features a film score composed by Mike Shinoda and Joseph Trapanese. It was released in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 14 August 2012.A sequel, The Raid 2, was released in 2014.
