{"text": "\n\nJean-Pierre Jeunet (French:\u00a0[\u0292\u0251\u0303 pj\u025b\u0281 \u0292\u0153n\u025b]; born 3 September 1953) is a French film director, producer, and screenwriter. His films are known to mix elements of fantasy, reality and science fiction either to create idealized realities or to give relevance to mundane situations. A former animator, his movies are marked by quirky, slapstick humor, alongside surrealist visuals.\nDebuting as a director with the acclaimed 1991 black comedy Delicatessen alongside his collaborator Marc Caro, Jeunet went to collaborate with Caro once again with The City of Lost Children (1995). His work with science fiction and horror led Jeunet to become the fourth director to helm the Alien film series with Alien Resurrection (1997), his first and only experience with an American film. In 2001, he would find his biggest success with the release of Am\u00e9lie, gaining international acclaim and reaching BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.Widely regarded as one of the most influential and important directors in modern French cinema, his critical and commercial success earned him three BAFTA Awards for Best Direction and two Academy Award nominations.\n", "wiki_page_id": 75718, "imdb_id": "tt0112682"}
