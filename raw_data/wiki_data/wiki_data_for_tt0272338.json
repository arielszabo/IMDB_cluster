Sandler stars as an entrepreneur with severe social anxiety who is set up on a date with his sister's co-worker. The two immediately fall in love with each other but he is forced to defend his new love interest and himself from thugs attempting to steal his identity and extort him.\nAfter the release of his previous film Magnolia (which ran over three hours), Anderson stated that he would like to work with Adam Sandler in the future and that he was determined to make his next film ninety minutes long. The film was produced by Revolution Studios and New Line Cinema, and distributed by Columbia Pictures; it features the video art of Jeremy Blake in the form of visual interludes. The film received positive reviews from critics, with Sandler's performance receiving critical praise, but failed to recoup its production budget at the box office.", "wiki_page_id": 630721, "imdb_id": "tt0272338"}
