{"text": "\n\nNymphomaniac (stylised as NYMPH()MANIAC onscreen and in advertising) is a 2013 European two-part art film written and directed by Lars von Trier. The film stars Charlotte Gainsbourg, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Stacy Martin, Shia LaBeouf, Christian Slater, Jamie Bell, Uma Thurman, Willem Dafoe and Connie Nielsen. The film was originally supposed to be only one complete entry; but, because of its multiple hour length, von Trier made the decision to split the project into two separate films. Nymphomaniac was an international co-production of Denmark, Belgium, France, and Germany.\nThe world premiere of the uncut version of \"Volume I\" of the original five-and-half-hour-long version occurred on 16 February 2014 at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. The world premiere of the uncut version of \"Volume II\" debuted at 2014's Venice Film Festival. A \"secret\" advance screening of Part I occurred at the Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2014, at the Egyptian Theater with tickets distributed bearing the film title \"Film X\" amidst rumors the film could either be von Trier's film, or Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel. The general release world premiere of the complete 5 1/2 hour director's cut took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 10 September 2014. The film was nominated for the 2014 Nordic Council Film Prize.\nNymphomaniac is the third and final installment in von Trier's unofficially titled \"Depression Trilogy\", having been preceded by Antichrist and Melancholia.\n", "wiki_page_id": 34470911, "imdb_id": "tt2382009"}
