{"text": "\n\nThe Hole is a 2001 British psychological horror film directed by Nick Hamm, and starring Thora Birch, Desmond Harrington, Keira Knightley, Daniel Brocklebank, and Embeth Davidtz. Based on the novel After the Hole by Guy Burt, the film follows a group of English preparatory school students who, upon spending a weekend partying in an underground shelter, find themselves locked inside.\nFilmed in 2000, the film featured actress Birch in the lead role, whose headlining credit and highly publicized seven-figure salary was attributed to her appearance in American Beauty (1999). It also marked Knightley's first major role in a feature film.\nThe film premiered in the United Kingdom in April 2001.  Dimension Films, which in October 2001 acquired the rights to distribute the film theatrically in the United States, never did so; it was instead released direct-to-video nearly two years later, by Dimension's then-fellow Disney subsidiary Buena Vista Distribution. The film was shot at Bray Studios and various locations around southern England, including Downside School in Somerset.\n", "wiki_page_id": 939670, "imdb_id": "tt0242527"}
