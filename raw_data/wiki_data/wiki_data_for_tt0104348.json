{"text": "Glengarry Glen Ross is a 1992 American drama film adapted by David Mamet from his 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name, and directed by James Foley. The film depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen and how they become desperate when the corporate office sends a trainer to \"motivate\" them by announcing that, in one week, all except the top two salesmen will be fired. It was filmed in New York City.Like the play, the film is notorious for its use of profanity, leading the cast to refer to the film jokingly as \"Death of a Fuckin' Salesman.\" The title of the film comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters: Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms.\nThe world premiere of the film was held at the 49th Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. Al Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his work in the film. The film grossed $10.7 million in North America on a $12.5 million budget.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2000074, "imdb_id": "tt0104348"}
