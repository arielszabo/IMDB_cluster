{"text": "Trick 'r Treat is a 2007 anthology dark comedy horror film written and directed by Michael Dougherty and produced by Bryan Singer. The film stars Dylan Baker, Rochelle Aytes, Anna Paquin and Brian Cox. It relates four Halloween horror stories with a common element in Sam, a mysterious child trick-or-treater wearing shabby orange footie pajamas with a burlap sack over his head. The character makes an appearance in each of the stories whenever a character breaks Halloween traditions.\nDespite being delayed for two years and having a small number of public screenings, the film received much critical acclaim and has since garnered a strong cult following. In October 2013, the filmmakers announced that a sequel, Trick 'r Treat 2, is in the works. In 2016, Michael Dougherty and Legendary Pictures teamed up with AtmosFX to create a series of digital Halloween decorations that feature Sam.  In 2017, a Trick 'r Treat themed \"scare zone\" was added to the Halloween Horror Nights event, which is held annually at the Universal Orlando Resort.", "wiki_page_id": 10380700, "imdb_id": "tt0862856"}
