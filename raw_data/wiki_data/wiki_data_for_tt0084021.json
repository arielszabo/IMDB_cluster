{"text": "\n\nGrease 2 is a 1982 American musical romantic comedy film and the sequel to Grease, which is based upon the musical of the same name by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. The film was produced by Allan Carr and Robert Stigwood, and directed and choreographed by Patricia Birch, who also choreographed the first film and the Broadway musical. It takes place two years after the original film at Rydell High School, set in the 1961-1962 school year, with an almost entirely new cast, led by actors Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer.\nThe film was released theatrically on June 11, 1982 and grossed over $15 million against a production budget of $11 million. The film, now best known for being Pfeiffer's breakout role, was otherwise poorly received, with Grease co-creator Jim Jacobs (who did not have any involvement with Grease 2) particularly displeased with the film.\n", "wiki_page_id": 289253, "imdb_id": "tt0084021"}
