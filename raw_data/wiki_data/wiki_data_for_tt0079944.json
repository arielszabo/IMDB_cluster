The film combines elements of science fiction with dramatic philosophical and psychological themes.The film depicts an expedition led by a figure known as the \"Stalker\" (Aleksandr Kaidanovsky) to take his two clients\u2014a melancholic writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn) seeking inspiration, and a professor (Nikolai Grinko) seeking scientific discovery\u2014to a mysterious restricted site known simply as the \"Zone,\" where there is a room which supposedly has the ability to fulfill a person's innermost desires. The trio travel through unnerving areas filled with the debris of modern society while engaging in many arguments. The \"Zone\" itself appears sentient, while their path through it can be sensed but not seen. In the film, a \"stalker\" is a professional guide to the Zone, someone having the ability and desire to cross the border into the dangerous and forbidden place with a specific goal.The meaning of the word \"stalk\" was derived from its use by the Strugatsky brothers in their novel Roadside Picnic, which alluded to Rudyard Kipling's character \"Stalky\" in his Stalky & Co. stories. In Roadside Picnic, \"Stalker\" was a common nickname for men engaged in the illegal enterprise of prospecting for and smuggling alien artifacts out of the \"Zone\". The common English definition of the term \"stalking\" was also cited by Andrei Tarkovsky.Stalker has been called one of the best drama films of the latter half of the 20th century, and ranks 29th on the British Film Institute's \"50 Greatest Films of All Time\" poll.", "wiki_page_id": 286266, "imdb_id": "tt0079944"}
