The film is about Cataleya  (Amandla Stenberg) (also a genus of orchids), a nine-year-old girl in Colombia whose family is killed by drug lord named Don Luis Sandoval (Beto Benites). Fifteen years later, a 24-year-old Cataleya (Zoe Saldana) has become an accomplished assassin. Even though Don Luis is now in the witness protection program in the U.S. and is guarded by many heavily armed gangsters, Cataleya uses every means at her disposal, including death threats to law enforcement officials, to find where Don Luis is hiding and avenge her family's death. While the film had a generally negative reception from critics, Saldana's action sequences were praised and the movie earned just under $61 million against a $40 million budget.\n\n", "wiki_page_id": 28763446, "imdb_id": "tt1657507"}
