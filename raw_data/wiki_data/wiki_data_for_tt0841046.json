{"text": "\n\nWalk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is a 2007 American comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan, and written by Kasdan and co-producer Judd Apatow. It stars John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Tim Meadows and Kristen Wiig. The plot echoes the storyline of 2005's Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line and 2004's Ray Charles biopic Ray. Walk Hard is a parody of the biopic genre as a whole.\nAs Walk Hard heavily references the film Walk the Line, the Dewey Cox persona is mostly based on Johnny Cash; but the character also includes elements of the lives and careers of Roy Orbison, Glen Campbell, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Jerry Lee Lewis, Donovan, John Lennon, James Brown, Jim Morrison, Conway Twitty, Neil Diamond, Hank Williams, and Brian Wilson. The film portrays fictional versions of artists Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles; also, some artists play themselves, including Eddie Vedder and Ghostface Killah. In addition, the film parodies or pays tribute to the musical styles of Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Billy Joel, Van Dyke Parks with Brian Wilson, and the seventies punk rock movement.\nThe film was released in North America on December 21, 2007.\n", "wiki_page_id": 9264215, "imdb_id": "tt0841046"}
