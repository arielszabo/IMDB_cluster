{"text": "Predators is a 2010 American science fiction action film directed by Nimr\u00f3d Antal and starring Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Walton Goggins, and Laurence Fishburne. It was distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the third installment of the Predator franchise (the fifth counting the two Alien vs. Predator films), following Predator (1987) and Predator 2 (1990). A sequel, The Predator, was released in 2018.\nThe film follows an ensemble cast of characters including Royce (Adrien Brody), a mercenary who appears in an unidentified jungle among other murderers and otherwise undesirable people. They find that they have been abducted and placed on a planet which acts as a game reserve for two warring tribes of extraterrestrial killers, and actively look for a way to return to Earth.\nProducer Robert Rodriguez had developed a script as early as 1994, although it was not until 2009 that 20th Century Fox greenlit the project. According to Rodriguez, the title Predators is an allusion to the second film in the Alien franchise, Aliens (1986). The title also has a double meaning, referring both to the extraterrestrial Predator creatures and to the group of human characters who are pitted against them. Principal photography for Predators began on September 28, 2009 and concluded after 53 days; filming took place in Hawaii and then in Austin, Texas.\nPredators was released in the United States on July 9, 2010, and Metacritic gave it a score of 51% from selected mainstream critics. The film grossed over $24 million on its opening weekend and has since grossed over $52 million in the United States, with an estimated total of $127 million worldwide.\n", "wiki_page_id": 24630747, "imdb_id": "tt1424381"}
