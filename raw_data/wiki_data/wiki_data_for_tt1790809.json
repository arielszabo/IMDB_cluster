{"text": "\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (released outside North America as Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge) is a 2017 American swashbuckler fantasy film, the fifth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series and the sequel to On Stranger Tides (2011). The film is directed by Joachim R\u00f8nning and Espen Sandberg from a script by Jeff Nathanson, with Jerry Bruckheimer serving again as producer. Johnny Depp, Kevin McNally and Geoffrey Rush reprise their roles as Jack Sparrow, Joshamee Gibbs and Hector Barbossa, respectively, and are joined in the cast by Javier Bardem, Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. \nThe filmmakers cited the series' first installment, The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), as inspiration for the script and tone of the film. Pre-production for the film started shortly before On Stranger Tides was released in early 2011, with Terry Rossio writing the initial script. In early 2013, Jeff Nathanson was hired to write a new script for the film, with Depp being involved in Nathanson's writing process. Initially planned for a 2015 release, the film was delayed to 2016 and then to 2017, after 6\u00a0years of development hell, due to script and budget issues. Principal photography started in Australia in February\u00a02015, after the Australian government offered Disney $20\u00a0million in tax incentives, and ended in July\u00a02015.\nDead Men Tell No Tales was released in conventional, 3D, and IMAX formats on May\u00a026, 2017. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $794\u00a0million worldwide against an estimated budget between $230\u2013320\u00a0million, though Dead Men Tell No Tales is the second-lowest grossing installment of the series.\n", "wiki_page_id": 41861349, "imdb_id": "tt1790809"}
