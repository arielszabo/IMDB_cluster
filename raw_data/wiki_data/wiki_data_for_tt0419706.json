{"text": "\n\nDoom is a 2005 American science fiction action horror film directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak and written by David Callaham and Wesley Strick, loosely based on the video game series of the same name created by id Software. Starring Karl Urban, Dwayne Johnson and Rosamund Pike, the film follows a group of marines in a research facility on Mars. After arriving on a rescue and retrieval mission after communications ceased, the marines soon battle genetically engineered monsters plaguing the facility.\nAfter film rights deals with Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures expired, id Software signed a deal with Warner Bros. with the stipulation that the film would be greenlit within a year. Warner Bros. lost the rights, which were subsequently given back to Universal, which started production in 2004. The film was an international co-production of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, and Germany.\nIn an interview, executive producer John Wells stated that a second film would be put into production if the first was a success at the box office. The film grossed $28.2 million in North America and $27.8 million overseas for a worldwide total of $56 million; based on a $60 million budget, the film was a box office bomb.\n", "wiki_page_id": 491757, "imdb_id": "tt0419706"}
