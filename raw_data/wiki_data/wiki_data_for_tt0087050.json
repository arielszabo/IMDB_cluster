{"text": "Children of the Corn (advertised as Stephen King's Children of the Corn) is a 1984 American horror film based upon Stephen King\u2019s 1977 short story of the same name. Directed by Fritz Kiersch, the film's cast consists of Peter Horton, Linda Hamilton, John Franklin, Courtney Gains, Robby Kiger, Anne Marie McEvoy, and Julie Maddalena and R. G. Armstrong. Set in the fictitious rural town of Gatlin, Nebraska, the film tells the story of a malevolent entity referred to as \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\" which entices the children of the town to ritually murder all the adults in town and a couple driving across country, to ensure a successful corn harvest.\nKing wrote the original draft of the screenplay, which focused more on the characters of Burt and Vicky and depicted more history on the uprising of the children in Gatlin. This script was disregarded in favor of George Goldsmith's screenplay, which featured more violence and a more conventional narrative structure. Filming took place mainly in Iowa, but also in California. Eight sequels have since been produced, and it has gained a cult following.\n", "wiki_page_id": 26946311, "imdb_id": "tt0087050"}
