{"text": "Badlands is a 1973 American crime film written and directed by Terrence Malick, starring Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, and featuring Warren Oates and Ramon Bieri. The story, though fictional, is loosely based on the real-life murder spree of Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate, in 1958, though that basis was not acknowledged when the film was released.\nLike other Malick films, Badlands is notable for its lyrical photography, and its music, which includes pieces by Carl Orff.\nBadlands is often cited by film critics as one of the greatest and most influential films of all-time. In 1993, four years after the United States National Film Registry was established, it was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".", "wiki_page_id": 68130, "imdb_id": "tt0069762"}
