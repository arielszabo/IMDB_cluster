{"text": "Three Colours: Red (French: Trois couleurs: Rouge, Polish: Trzy kolory. Czerwony) is a 1994 romantic mystery film co-written, produced and directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski. It is the final installment of the Three Colours Trilogy, which examines the French Revolutionary ideals; it is preceded by Blue and White. Kie\u015blowski had announced that this would be his final film, which proved true with the director's sudden death in 1996. Red is about fraternity, which it examines by showing characters whose lives gradually become closely interconnected, with bonds forming between two characters who appear to have little in common.\nRed was released to universal critical acclaim, and was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Director for Kie\u015blowski. It was also selected as the Swiss entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 67th Academy Awards, but was disqualified for not being a majority-Swiss production.", "wiki_page_id": 23777614, "imdb_id": "tt0111495"}
