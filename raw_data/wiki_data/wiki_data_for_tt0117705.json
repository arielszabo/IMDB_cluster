The film was produced by Ivan Reitman, and directed by Joe Pytka. Nigel Miguel was a basketball technical advisor. Space Jam presents an alternate history of what happened between Jordan's initial retirement from the NBA in 1993 and his comeback in 1995, in which he is enlisted by Bugs Bunny and his friends to help them win a basketball match against a group of aliens who want to enslave them for their amusement park. The film also serves to introduce a new Looney Tunes character, Bugs' love interest  Lola Bunny.\nReleased theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures under their Family Entertainment label on November 15, 1996, Space Jam opened at No. 1 in the US and grossed over $230 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing basketball film of all-time. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who were divided on the merits of combining Jordan and his profession with the Looney Tunes characters, and was particularly criticized by veteran animator and Looney Tunes director Chuck Jones.\n", "wiki_page_id": 265033, "imdb_id": "tt0117705"}
