{"text": "\n\nCity of God (Portuguese: Cidade de Deus) is a 2002 Brazilian crime film directed by Fernando Meirelles and co-directed by K\u00e1tia Lund, released in its home country in 2002 and worldwide in 2003. The story was adapted by Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani from the 1997 novel of the same name written by Paulo Lins, but the plot is loosely based on real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1980s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Li'l Z\u00e9 and vigilante-turned-criminal Knockout Ned. The tagline is \"If you run, the beast catches you; if you stay, the beast eats you\", a proverb analogous to the English \"Damned if you do, damned if you don't\".\nThe cast includes Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora, Phellipe Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Alice Braga and Seu Jorge. Most of the actors were, in fact, residents of favelas such as Vidigal and the Cidade de Deus itself.\nThe film received worldwide critical acclaim and was nominated for four Academy Awards in 2004: Best Cinematography (C\u00e9sar Charlone), Best Director (Meirelles), Best Editing (Daniel Rezende), and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) (Mantovani). In 2003, it was Brazil's entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but it did not end up being nominated as one of the five finalists.\nMeirelles and Lund went on to create the City of Men TV series and film City of Men (2007), which share some of the actors (notably leads Douglas Silva and Darlan Cunha) and their setting with City of God.\n", "wiki_page_id": 461322, "imdb_id": "tt0317248"}
