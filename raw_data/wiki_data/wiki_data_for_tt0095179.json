{"text": "Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood is a 1988 American supernatural slasher film directed by John Carl Buechler and starring Lar Park Lincoln, Kevin Blair, and Susan Blu. It is the seventh installment in the Friday the 13th film series, and the first film to feature Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees, who would continue to portray the character in three subsequent installments. The film follows a psychokinetic teenage girl who inadvertently unleashes Jason from his grave in Crystal Lake, where she and her friends are staying.\nThe film was released after Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, and was intended to have a higher standard of quality than that of the previous installments, with high-profile directors being considered to helm the project. Paramount Pictures sought a partnership with New Line Cinema to create a crossover film between the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street series, which would not come to fruition until 2003, as Freddy vs. Jason. After several failed concepts, screenwriter Daryl Haney suggested an idea akin to \"Jason vs. Carrie\", in which Jason would battle a teenage girl with psychokinetic abilities. The New Blood was followed by Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan.\n", "wiki_page_id": 2546472, "imdb_id": "tt0095179"}
