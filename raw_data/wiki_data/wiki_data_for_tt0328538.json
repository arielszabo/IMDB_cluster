{"text": "Thirteen is a 2003 American independent drama film directed by Catherine Hardwicke, written by Hardwicke and Nikki Reed, and starring Evan Rachel Wood, Holly Hunter, and Reed. Loosely based on Reed's life from ages 12 to 13, the film's plot follows Tracy, a junior high school student in Los Angeles who begins dabbling in substance abuse, sex, and crime after being befriended by a troubled classmate. It features Brady Corbet, Deborah Kara Unger, Kip Pardue, and Vanessa Anne Hudgens in supporting roles.\nThe screenplay for Thirteen was written over a period of six days by Hardwicke and the then-14-year-old Reed; Hardwicke, a former production designer, independently raised funds herself for the production. Filming took place on location in Los Angeles in 2002, largely shot with hand-held cameras, evoking a cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 visual style. \nUpon the film's debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2003, Hardwicke won the Sundance Directing (Drama) for the film. Fox Searchlight Pictures subsequently acquired Thirteen for distribution, giving the film a limited release in the United States beginning on August 20, 2003; the release would expand in September 2003, and the film went on to gross a total of $4.6 million at the United States box office.\nThough it received numerous favorable reviews from critics, Thirteen generated some controversy for its depiction of youth drug use (including inhalants, marijuana, and alcohol), underage sexual behavior, and self-harm. The film earned Holly Hunter an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Golden Globe nominations for Hunter and Evan Rachel Wood for Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress in a Drama, respectively.\n", "wiki_page_id": 468353, "imdb_id": "tt0328538"}
