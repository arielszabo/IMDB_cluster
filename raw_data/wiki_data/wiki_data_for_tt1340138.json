{"text": "\n\nTerminator Genisys is a 2015 American science fiction film directed by Alan Taylor and written by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier. The fifth installment in the Terminator franchise, it serves as a soft reboot of the series, using the plot element of time travel to erase the events of the previous films from the series' continuity. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, who reprises his role as the eponymous character, alongside Jason Clarke, Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, and J. K. Simmons. It follows soldier Kyle Reese, a soldier in the war against Skynet, who is sent from 2029 to 1984 by John Connor, leader of the Human Resistance, to protect his mother Sarah. When Kyle arrives in the past, he discovers that the timeline has been altered and Sarah has been raised by a reprogrammed Terminator.\nMegan Ellison and her production company Annapurna Pictures acquired the franchise rights in May 2011. The following year, production of another installment in the series was set up in collaboration with Skydance Productions, owned by Ellison's brother David. The Ellisons consulted Terminator creator James Cameron in the hope of returning to the spirit of The Terminator (1984) and its sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Principal photography was primarily in New Orleans, with some in the on-screen setting of San Francisco. Six companies handled the film's visual effects, with its prosthetic make-up and animatronics created by Legacy Effects.\nThe film was released by Paramount Pictures on July 1, 2015, in RealD 3D and IMAX 3D. It was not well-received by critics, who found its story and performances unsatisfactory, although Schwarzenegger's return to the franchise was praised. Terminator Genisys grossed over $440 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of the franchise and of Schwarzenegger's career, behind Terminator 2\u00a0: Judgment Day.", "wiki_page_id": 44609083, "imdb_id": "tt1340138"}
