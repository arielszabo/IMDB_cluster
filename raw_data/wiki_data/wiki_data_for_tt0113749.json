{"text": "\n\nMallrats is a 1995 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Kevin Smith. It is the second film in the View Askewniverse after 1994's Clerks, although, chronologically, Mallrats takes place the same day as Clerks, no explanation is offered as to how Jay and Silent Bob can both be present for extended hours on the same Saturday after Julie Dwyer  has died. \nAs in the other Askewniverse films, the characters Jay and Silent Bob feature prominently, and characters and events from other films are discussed. Several cast members, including Jason Lee, Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams, have gone on to work in several other Smith films. Comic-book icon Stan Lee appeared, as did Brian O'Halloran, the star of Smith's breakout feature Clerks.\nPlans for a sequel, MallBrats, were announced in March 2015. In June 2016, Smith announced that the sequel would instead be a 10-episode TV series; in February 2017, Smith announced that he had not been able to sell the TV series to any network, and the sequel was shelved indefinitely.\n", "wiki_page_id": 236651, "imdb_id": "tt0113749"}
