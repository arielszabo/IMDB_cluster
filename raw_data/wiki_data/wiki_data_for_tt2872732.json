Johansson portrays the title character, a woman who gains psychokinetic abilities when a nootropic drug is absorbed into her bloodstream.\nThe film was released on July 25, 2014, and became a box office success, grossing over $463\u00a0million, 11 times the budget of $40\u00a0million. It received positive, but also polarizing, critical reviews. Although praise was given for its themes, visuals, and Johansson's performance, a number of critics found the plot nonsensical, especially its focus on the ten percent of the brain myth and resulting abilities.\n", "wiki_page_id": 40740387, "imdb_id": "tt2872732"}
