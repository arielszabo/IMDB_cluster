{"text": "The Double Life of Veronique (French: La double vie de V\u00e9ronique, Polish: Podw\u00f3jne \u017cycie Weroniki) is a 1991 French-Polish-Norwegian drama film directed by Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski and starring Ir\u00e8ne Jacob. Written by Kie\u015blowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, the film explores the themes of identity, love, and human intuition through the characters of Weronika, a Polish choir soprano, and her double, V\u00e9ronique, a French music teacher. The two women do not know each other, and yet they share a mysterious and emotional bond that transcends language and geography.\nThe Double Life of Veronique is notable for S\u0142awomir Idziak's innovative cinematography and Zbigniew Preisner's operatic score. The film was Kie\u015blowski's first to be produced partly outside his native Poland. It won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival for Krzysztof Kieslowski, and the Best Actress Award for Ir\u00e8ne Jacob. The Double Life of Veronique was selected as the Polish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.", "wiki_page_id": 733176, "imdb_id": "tt0101765"}
