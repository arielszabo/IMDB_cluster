{"text": "\n\nLicence to Kill is a 1989 British spy film, the sixteenth in the James Bond film series produced by Eon Productions, and the last to star Timothy Dalton in the role of the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is the first one not to use the title of an Ian Fleming story. It is also the fifth and final consecutive Bond film to be directed by John Glen. The story has elements of two Ian Fleming short stories and a novel, interwoven with aspects from Japanese R\u014dnin tales. The film sees Bond being suspended from MI6 as he pursues drugs lord Franz Sanchez, who has ordered an attack against his CIA friend Felix Leiter and the murder of Felix's wife during their honeymoon. Originally titled Licence Revoked in line with the plot, the name was changed during post-production due to American test audiences associating the term with driving.\nBudgetary reasons caused Licence to Kill to be the first Bond film shot completely outside the United Kingdom, with locations in both Mexico and the US. The film earned over $156 million worldwide, and enjoyed a generally positive critical reception, with ample praise for the stunts, but attracted some criticism for its significantly darker and more violent tone than its predecessors, which carried into Dalton's portrayal of the character.\n", "wiki_page_id": 449547, "imdb_id": "tt0097742"}
