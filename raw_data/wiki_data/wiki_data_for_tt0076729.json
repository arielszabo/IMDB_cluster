The film is the sequel to the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit.\nThe film was originally released in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and several other, mainly Commonwealth countries as Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again. Early video releases and TV broadcasts also used this title, but in more recent years have reverted to the original U.S. title. It was followed by a sequel three years later, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983), in which Reynolds appeared only in a brief cameo appearance, and Sally Field was absent completely.\nThe plot centers on Bo \"Bandit\" Darville (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow (Jerry Reed), transporting an elephant to the GOP National Convention, with Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) in hot pursuit once again.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1331978, "imdb_id": "tt0076729"}
