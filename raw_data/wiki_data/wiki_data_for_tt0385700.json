The film has received mixed reviews. Critics have praised its animation and CGI work, but the plot has been criticized as both incomprehensible to viewers who did not play Final Fantasy VII and as a thin connection between action scenes. It received the \"Maria Award\" at the Sitges Film Festival in 2005 and the \"Best Anime Feature\" at the 2007 American Anime Awards. The original release was one of the best-selling animated movies in its release year in both Japan and the United States, and the Complete release was noted as driving a large increase in sales of the PlayStation 3 console in its release week. By May 2009, the DVD and Universal Media Disc releases had sold over 4.1\u00a0million copies worldwide.\n", "wiki_page_id": 670013, "imdb_id": "tt0385700"}
