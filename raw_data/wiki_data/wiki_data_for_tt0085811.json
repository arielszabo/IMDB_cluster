{"text": "\n\nKrull is a 1983 British-American science fantasy swashbuckler film directed by Peter Yates and produced by Ron Silverman with a screenplay by Stanford Sherman. It follows a journey of Prince Colwyn and his group of outlaws on the planet Krull to save future queen Princess Lyssa from a creature named \"The Beast\" and his constantly teleporting lair named the \"Black Fortress.\" The film began development in 1980, when Columbia Pictures president Frank Price gave Silverman the idea to produce a fantasy film, and was finally released in July 1983. Yates' directing on Krull differed from his previous films that were more realistic; he took the \"challenge\" of directing a motion picture like Krull since he could rely only on his imagination instead of doing research, and screenplays that encouraged experimentation with modern special effects were rare in the early 1980s.\nKrull consists of an ensemble cast of Ken Marshall as Prince Colwyn, Lysette Anthony as Princess Lyssa, Trevor Martin as the voice of the Beast, Freddie Jones as Ynyr, Bernard Bresslaw as Rell the Cyclops, David Battley as Ergo the Magnificent, Tony Church and Bernard Archard as kings and the fathers of Colwyn and Lyssa, Alun Armstrong as the leader of a group of bandits that include early screen roles for actors Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane, John Welsh as The Emerald Seer, Graham McGrath as Titch, and Francesca Annis as The Widow of the Web.\nKrull went through a very expensive, harsh and dangerous production process. The film's huge budget mainly came from the designers having to make numerous alterations to the sets. Krull was shot at several sound stages at Pinewood Studios, and actors such as Marshall, Bresslaw and Jones had to perform dangerous stunts during filming. Despite these efforts, the film was a commercial failure upon release, and critical opinion, both upon release and in retrospect, has been mixed. Numerous reviewers have highlighted its visual effects and soundtrack, while several critics have criticized its derivative and nonsensical plot. However, the film has gone on to achieve cult film status.\n", "wiki_page_id": 4622896, "imdb_id": "tt0085811"}
