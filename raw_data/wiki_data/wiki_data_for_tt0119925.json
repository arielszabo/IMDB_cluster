{"text": "The Postman is a 1997 American epic western post-apocalyptic adventure film. It is directed by, produced by, and stars Kevin Costner, with the screenplay written by Eric Roth and Brian Helgeland, based on David Brin's 1985 book of the same name. The film also features Will Patton, Larenz Tate, Olivia Williams, James Russo, and Tom Petty.\nIt is set in a post-apocalyptic and neo-Western version of the United States in the then near-future year of 2013, sixteen-plus years after unspecified apocalyptic events, starting with the breakdown of society through \u201chate crimes and racially motivated attacks (by) a militia-like group\u201d led by Nathan Holn, progressing to war, followed by plagues, that collectively left a huge impact on human civilization and erased most technology. Like the book, the film follows the story of a nomadic drifter (Costner) who stumbles across the uniform of an old United States Postal Service mail carrier, and unwittingly inspires hope through an empty promise of a \"Restored United States of America.\"\nReleased on Christmas of 1997 from Warner Bros., The Postman was a major critical and commercial failure, grossing a total of $17 million worldwide.\n", "wiki_page_id": 7570243, "imdb_id": "tt0119925"}
