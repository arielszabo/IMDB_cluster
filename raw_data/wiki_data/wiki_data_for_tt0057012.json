It follows the President of the United States, his advisors, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse. It separately follows the crew of one B-52 bomber as they try to deliver their payload.\nIn 1989, the United States Library of Congress included Dr. Strangelove in the first group of films selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.
