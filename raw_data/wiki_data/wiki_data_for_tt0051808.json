George Lucas's original plot outline for Star Wars has been noted as having a strong resemblance to the plot of The Hidden Fortress, which would also be reused for The Phantom Menace. Lucas has acknowledged the heavy influence of The Hidden Fortress on Star Wars, particularly in the technique of telling the story from the perspective of the film's lowliest characters, C-3PO  and R2-D2.", "wiki_page_id": 270759, "imdb_id": "tt0051808"}
