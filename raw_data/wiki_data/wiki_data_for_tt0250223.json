Based on the book Asterix and Cleopatra, which had previously been adapted into a 1968 animated film, it also acts as a sequel to the 1999 movie Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar.\nChristian Clavier and G\u00e9rard Depardieu reprise their roles as Asterix and Obelix, alongside newcomers Jamel Debbouze, Monica Bellucci, Claude Rich, G\u00e9rard Darmon, \u00c9douard Baer, Dieudonn\u00e9, and Chabat himself.\nIt was the most expensive French movie at that time, before being beaten by A Very Long Engagement two years later. A critical success, it was also a major box office success in France, becoming its most successful film in 36 years and second biggest commercial success of all time after 1966's La Grande Vadrouille.\n", "wiki_page_id": 8409497, "imdb_id": "tt0250223"}
