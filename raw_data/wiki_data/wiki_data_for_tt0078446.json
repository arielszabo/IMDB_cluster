{"text": "\n\nUp in Smoke is a 1978 American stoner comedy film directed by Lou Adler and Cheech & Chong's first feature-length film. It stars Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong, Edie Adams, Strother Martin, Stacy Keach, and Tom Skerritt.  \nCheech & Chong had been a counterculture comedy team for about ten years before they started reworking some of their material for their first film. Much of the film was shot in Los Angeles, California, including scenes set in Tijuana, while scenes set on the Mexican border were actually filmed at the border in Yuma, Arizona.\nWhile negatively received upon its release, Up in Smoke is credited with establishing the stoner comedy genre. It\u2019s now considered a classic.\n", "wiki_page_id": 1274418, "imdb_id": "tt0078446"}
