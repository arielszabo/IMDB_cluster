Led by a former Jedi named Count Dooku, thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. After Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala evades assassination, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker becomes her protector, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates the attempt on Padm\u00e9's life. Soon Anakin, Padm\u00e9 and Obi-Wan witness the onset of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars.\nDevelopment of Attack of the Clones began in March 2000, after the release of The Phantom Menace.
