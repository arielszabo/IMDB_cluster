{"text": "\n\nHansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is a 2013 dark fantasy action horror comedy film written and directed by Tommy Wirkola. It is a continuation to the German folklore fairy tale \"Hansel and Gretel\", in which the titular siblings are now grown up and working as a duo of witch exterminators for hire. The film stars Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Famke Janssen, Peter Stormare, Thomas Mann, Pihla Viitala and Derek Mears.\nOriginally scheduled for release in March 2012, Hansel & Gretel was delayed for ten months to accommodate Renner's appearances in The Avengers and The Bourne Legacy and to give Wirkola time to shoot a post-credits scene. It premiered in North America on January 25, 2013, in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D, as well in D-Box motion theaters and select international 4DX theaters, and was rated R in the United States. The film had its home media release on June 11, including a longer, unrated version on Blu-ray.\nThe film was panned by mainstream critics, particularly for what they saw as its weak script and gratuitous violence. However, many horror genre critics were more positive, viewing the film as unpretentiously entertaining. The film topped the domestic box office on its opening weekend and was a major hit in Brazil, Russia, Germany, and Mexico. Its worldwide theatrical run gross exceeded $226 million for the production cost of $50 million. Following the commercial success of the film, which was planned as the first part of a series, its sequel is currently in development.\n", "wiki_page_id": 27223546, "imdb_id": "tt1428538"}
