{"text": "\n\nBraindead (also known as Dead Alive in North America) is a 1992 New Zealand splatstick  comedy horror film directed by Peter Jackson, produced by Jim Booth, and written by Jackson, along with Fran Walsh and Stephen Sinclair.\nThe film follows Lionel, a village dweeb living with his mother Vera in a Victorian mansion, who constantly gets into trouble for his relationship with a Spanish shopkeeper's daughter, Paquita. When a rabid rat-monkey bites Vera, she gradually converts the residents of Newtown into a zombie horde.\nSince its release, Braindead has received acclaim from critics, with many filmmakers and critics calling it \"The Goriest Fright Film of All Time\". Although a bomb financially at the time of its release, the film since gained a cult following, with more attention after Jackson's success with The Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n", "wiki_page_id": 142588, "imdb_id": "tt0103873"}
