{"text": "\n\nRomeo and Juliet is a 1968 British-Italian romantic drama film based on the play of the same name, written 1591\u20131595 by famed English playwright / author William Shakespeare (1564\u20131616).\nThe film was directed and co-written by Franco Zeffirelli, and stars Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. It won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography (Pasqualino De Santis) and Best Costume Design (Danilo Donati); it was also nominated for Best Director and Best Picture, making it the last Shakespearean film to be nominated for Best Picture to date. Sir Laurence Olivier spoke the film's prologue and epilogue and reportedly dubbed the voice of the Italian actor playing Lord Montague, but was not credited in the film.\nBeing the most financially successful film adaptation of a Shakespeare play at the time of its release, it was popular among teenagers partly because it was the first film to use actors who were close to the age of the characters from the original play. Several critics also welcomed the film enthusiastically.", "wiki_page_id": 99025, "imdb_id": "tt0063518"}
