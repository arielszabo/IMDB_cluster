{"text": "\n\nLet the Right One In (Swedish: L\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in) is a 2008 Swedish romantic horror film directed by Tomas Alfredson, based on the 2004 novel of the same title by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also wrote the screenplay. The film tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a vampire child in Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, in the early 1980s. Alfredson, unconcerned with the horror and vampire conventions, decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters. Selecting the lead actors involved a year-long process with open castings held all over Sweden. In the end, the 11-year-olds K\u00e5re Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson were chosen for the leading roles. They were subsequently commended by both Alfredson and film reviewers for their performances.\nThe film received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the \"Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature\" at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival and the European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation's 2008 M\u00e9li\u00e8s d'Or (Golden M\u00e9li\u00e8s) for the \"Best European Fantastic Feature Film\", as well as four Guldbagge Awards from the Swedish Film Institute and the Saturn Award for Best International Film.\n", "wiki_page_id": 16881835, "imdb_id": "tt1139797"}
