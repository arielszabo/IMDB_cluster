It is based on the Japanese manga of the same name written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. Oldboy is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, preceded by Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and followed by Lady Vengeance.\nThe film follows the story of Oh Dae-su, who is imprisoned in a cell which resembles a hotel room for 15 years without knowing the identity of his captor or his captor's motives. When he is finally released, Dae-su finds himself still trapped in a web of conspiracy and violence. His own quest for vengeance becomes tied in with romance when he falls in love with an attractive young sushi chef.\nThe film won the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival and high praise from the President of the Jury, director Quentin Tarantino. Critically, the film has been well received in the United States, with an 80% \"Certified Fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Film critic Roger Ebert stated that Oldboy is a \"powerful film not because of what it depicts, but because of the depths of the human heart which it strips bare\". It has been listed among the best films of the 2000s in several publications.\nAn American remake with the same title was released in 2013. It was directed by Spike Lee.\n", "wiki_page_id": 734207, "imdb_id": "tt0364569"}
