{"text": "\n\nBernie is a 2011 American black comedy film directed by Richard Linklater, and written by Linklater and Skip Hollandsworth. The film stars Jack Black, Shirley MacLaine and Matthew McConaughey. It is based on a 1998 Texas Monthly magazine article by Hollandsworth, \"Midnight in the Garden of East Texas,\" that chronicles the 1996 murder of 80-year-old millionaire Marjorie Nugent in Carthage, Texas by her 39-year-old companion, Bernhardt \"Bernie\" Tiede. Tiede proved so highly regarded in Carthage that, in spite of having confessed to the police, the district attorney was eventually forced to request a rare prosecutorial change of venue in order to secure a fair trial.\nThe film went on to receive critical acclaim for its direction, accuracy to the real-life event, \"Town Gossips\" element, and particular praise for Jack Black's portrayal of Tiede, with many calling it his best performance to date.", "wiki_page_id": 29424022, "imdb_id": "tt1704573"}
