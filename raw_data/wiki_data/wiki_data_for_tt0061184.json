{"text": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a play by Edward Albee first staged in 1962. It examines the complexities of the marriage of a middle-aged couple, Martha and George.  Late one evening, after a university faculty party, they receive an unwitting younger couple, Nick and Honey, as guests, and draw them into their bitter and frustrated relationship.\nThe play is in three acts, normally taking a little less than three hours to perform, with two 10-minute intermissions. The title is a pun on the song \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\" from Walt Disney's Three Little Pigs (1933), substituting the name of the celebrated English author Virginia Woolf. Martha and George repeatedly sing this version of the song throughout the play.\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? won both the 1963 Tony Award for Best Play and the 1962\u201363 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play. It is frequently revived on the modern stage. The film adaptation was released in 1966, written by Ernest Lehman, directed by Mike Nichols, and starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, George Segal and Sandy Dennis.\n", "wiki_page_id": 44885, "imdb_id": "tt0061184"}
