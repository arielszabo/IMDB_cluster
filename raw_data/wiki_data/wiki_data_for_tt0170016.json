{"text": "\n\nHow the Grinch Stole Christmas (also known as Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas) is a 2000 American Christmas comedy film directed by Ron Howard and written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, based on Dr. Seuss\u2019s 1957 story of the same name. The film was released by Universal Pictures on November 17, 2000. It was the first Dr. Seuss book to be adapted into a full-length feature film.\nBecause the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions were made to the storyline to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the title character and reworking the story's minor character Cindy Lou Who as a main character. Most of the rhymes that were used in the book were also used in the film, though some of the lines were to some degree changed, and several new rhymes were put in.\nThe film also borrowed some music and character elements (such as the Grinch's green skin tone) that originated in the 1966 animated TV special How the Grinch Stole Christmas!. The film was produced by Howard and Brian Grazer, and starring Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Josh Ryan Evans (in his final theatrical role), narration by Anthony Hopkins and introducing Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.\nThe film spent four weeks at #1 in the United States and grossed $260 million in the United States, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2000 in the United States, and over $345 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest grossing film of 2000 and the second highest-grossing holiday film of all time, with Home Alone being the first.It won the Academy Award for Best Makeup, and was also nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.\n", "wiki_page_id": 4867859, "imdb_id": "tt0170016"}
